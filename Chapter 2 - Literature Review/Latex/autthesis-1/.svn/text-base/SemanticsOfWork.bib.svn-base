It identifies five definitions of IT artifact and IT-enabled work system, and then looks in detail at whether the definition of work system mattered in Jasperson, Carter, and Zmud's [2005] article in MIS Quarterly about post-adoptive behaviors.  It argues that their definition perhaps affected their conceptualization of post-adoptive behaviors. It presents an alternative model illustrating how a different definition and greater attention to wormight have led to a different conceptualization that addresses different issues.},

In this short paper, I voice my concern that emphasis on methodological accountability may well inhibit criticality, and I argue for the need to recognize that researchers bring into their investigation tacit knowledge, emotions, and moral and political convictions that cannot be rationalized in methodological descriptions. Moreover, I suggest that critical research should maintain suspicion to instrumental reasoning and that it should place its effort to producing knowledge on an alternative agenda of substantive social issues by the interplay of theory and empirical evidence.},

	Abstract = {While its roots can be traced back to at least the 19th century (cf. Raeithel, 1992), Activity Theory was mainly a result of a larger effort to develop a new psychology based on Marxist philosophy, an effort which started soon after the Russian revolution of 1917. Several programs for restructuring psychology on a Marxist basis were formulated in the 20's and 30's, and very heated debates between proponents of different approaches were not uncommon at that time. One of the first postulates Soviet psychologists agreed upon was the so-called ``principle of unity and inseparability of consciousness (i.e., human mind) and activity''. The meaning of this principle was that human mind comes to exist, develops, and can only be understood within the context of meaningful, goal-oriented, and socially determined interaction between human beings and their material environment.},

Within these environments, service discovery enabled by service discovery protocols (SDPs) is a critical functionality for establishing ad hoc associations between service providers and service requesters. Furthermore, the dynamics, the openness and the user-centric vision aimed at by the pervasive computing paradigm call for solutions that enable rich, semantic, context- and QoS-aware service discovery. Although the semantic Web paradigm envisions to achieve such support, current solutions are hardly deployable in the pervasive environment due to the costly underlying semantic reasoning with ontologies. In this article, we present EASY to support efficient, semantic, context- and QoS-aware service discovery on top of existing SDPs. EASY provides EASY-L, a langua},

	Abstract = {The field of library and information science (US) has built its practice and research perspective on a logico-analytic philosophy, which has generated useful, tangible technologies. Lately there is interest in nonempirical philosophies, such as hermeneutics and critical theory, to fulfill better US' service oriented mission of providing ``information'' to user populations. One dimension of critical theory, Jurgen Habermas' theory of communicative action, can expand US' conception of information and supplement logico-empirical research methods and research practices. This article examines how US, particularly research into librarian-patron interaction and information system design, favors an empiricist view of language and, as a consequence, may be limiting its effectiveness. It proposes how the field might expand to include communicative action in fulfilling its mission and research agenda.},

   Abstract = {Many of the problems and failures of Management Information Systems (MIS) and Management SciencelOperations Research (MSIOR) projects have been attributed to organizational behavioral problems. The millions of dollars organizations spend on MIS and MS/OR development are of little benefit because systems continue to fail. Steps can be taken to understand and solve these behavioral problems. \\This article argues that in most cases these behavioral problems are the result of inadequate designs. These bad designs are attributed to the way MIS systems designers view organizations, their members, and the function of an MIS within them, ie., systems designers' frames of reference. These frames of reference cause faulty design choices and failures to perceive better design alternatives. Seven conditions are discussed which reflect current systems designers' points of view. The discussion of these conditions demonstrates the need to reframe MIS design methodology within the Socio-Technical Systems (STS) design approach and change systems designers' peispectives. The STS approach is introduced as a realistic view of organizations and a way to change them. \\This article is the first of two to appear in consecutive issues of the MIS Quarterly. The purpose of this first article is to demonstrate the need for the STS appro?ch, The second will present the basic concepts and principles of the STS methodology and how it can be utilized in the design of an MIS.},

That paper conducted a preliminary review of the state of critical thinking in the fields of information systems (IS) and organization. In addressing the question `what is critical research?' it showed how its definition has changed and broadened over time. This paper follows on by opening up some key questions relating to why researchers in IS should view critical research as having a valuable contribution to make. It begins by considering the apparently wide range of researchers for whom critical research has become an activity. Noting earlier calls for more empirical research, the paper looks at some examples of specific empirical applications. This leads us to consider how critical research impacts upon actual IS praxis, in particular the role of the IS professional, systems development and changes in the nature of organizational life itself. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the literature. Rather by drawing upon a sample of material covering a range of perspectives it aims to give an impression of the many developments in critical studies on organization and IS and to consider their implications for future direction.},

@article{ChenHerschheim2004,
	Abstract = {The field of information systems (IS) has evolved for more than three decades. Although many schools of thought have emerged and even become well established, few historical analyses of research paradigms and methodologies have been undertaken. One of the rare exceptions is Orlikowski & Baroudi (1991). Yet, the IS research community has evolved substantially since 1991 in many aspects. A variety of journal outlets have emerged and become well established. More attention has been paid to paradigmatic and methodological issues. Political and professional contexts have also changed noticeably. Therefore, it should be an opportune time for the field to ask: 'What changes are manifested in journal publications? ''Is the field making progress regarding pluralism in IS research? ''How will the field's publications practices change in the future?'' The purpose of this paper is to investigate these questions and, in turn, reflect on the paradigmatic and methodological progress made since 1991. We examined 1893 articles published in eight major IS publication outlets between 1991 and 2001. Our findings suggest that the long-term endeavours of interpretivist researchers might need to continue because the paradigmatic progress appears somewhat inconsequential; positivist research still dominates 81\% of published empirical research. In particular, US journals, as opposed to European journals, tend to be more positivist, quantitative, cross-sectional and survey oriented. With respect to research design, survey research is still the most widely used method (41\%), although case studies have gained substantial recognition (36\%). Further, the increase of qualitative research (30\%), empirical studies (61\%) and longitudinal cases (33\%) at the expense of laboratory experiments (18\%) might suggest that IS researchers have become more interested in obtaining scientific knowledge in real world settings. In summary, we suggest that the field has been dominated by the positivist paradigm, despite calls to the contrary. Indeed, if the field was to truly embrace pluralism, it would have to find ways to fundamentally change the publication practices of the journal system, including the current tenure and promotion system, which pose considerable obstacles for the acceptance of alternative paradigms.},

	Abstract = {In the last fifteen years, academic research on information systems (IS) outsourcing has evolved rapidly. Indeed the field of outsourcing research has grown so fast that there has been scant opportunity for the research community to take a collective breath, and complete a global assessment of research activities to date. This paper seeks to address this need by exploring and synthesizing the academic literature on IS outsourcing. It offers a roadmap of the IS outsourcing literature, highlighting what has been done so far, how the work fits together under a common umbrella, and what the future directions might be. \\In order to adequately address the immense diversity of research on IS outsourcing and outsourcing in general, we develop a conceptual framework that helps us to categorize the literature. In particular, we look at the research objectives, methods used and theoretical foundations of the papers. In identifying the major research objectives, we view outsourcing as an organizational decision process and adapt Simon's stage model of decision making. This allows us to identify five major sourcing issues, from which at least one is covered by each academic article. These are the questions of why to outsource, what to outsource, which decision process to take, how to implement the sourcing decision, and what is the outcome of the sourcing decision. In analyzing the literature, we identify and structure the main explanatory factors and theoretical relationships within each of these sourcing stages. Based on our discussion of the research objectives, theoretical foundations and research approaches taken in the literature, we show how the various research streams hang together and we come up with a number of implications for research. Moreover, we identify a number of emerging sourcing issues. We believe that research on these ``new'' phenomena such as offshore outsourcing, application service providing and business process outsourcing would benefit from `standing on the shoulders' of what has already been accomplished in the field of IS outsourcing.},

A recent IFIP conference on Organisational and Social Perspectives on Information technology examines some of the social and organisational issues involved in IS Research (IFIP TC8 WG8.2, 2000). At this conference Jones (2000) examines the number of citations in the IFIP WG8.2 conference literature that refer to social theorists as a means to determine the level of interest in the use of social theory within IS. Over the period 1979-1999 57\%{} of papers had references to social theorists --- the four major theorists being Giddens, Habermas, Foucault and Latour. This paper suggests that it would be useful to widen the range of social theorists used in IS to include that of Bhaskar who proposes a critical realist approach to social research.

@article{Dupuy2004,
	Abstract = {This paper explores how the self-constitution of the social order is affected by a property of human desire that is seldom taken seriously in the social sciences, namely the fact that desire is essentially triangular. It brings into play a subject, an object, and a mediator or third party whom the subject imitates. It is suggested that the difficult issue of the embodiment of social cognition finds its solution in the role played by the third party. It is shown that Friedrich Hayek and John Maynard Keynes were familiar with this pattern. The paper focuses on the role played by imitation in Hayek's conception of the social order as spontaneous or self-organized. Many apparent contradictions in Hayek's social philosophy are explained (away) when one realizes that Hayek remains oblivious to the ambivalence of imitation. Imitation is efficient if the correct information is present somewhere and recognized as such, but otherwise it becomes a source of illusions and waste. The problem is that it is impossible from inside the system to know in which of the two cases one finds oneself. To overcome this undecidability, it is necessary to resort to an exteriority. Generalized imitation has the power to create worlds that are perfectly disconnected from reality: at once orderly, stable, and totally illusory. The notion of collective or social self-deception is illustrated with the case of gift giving. The conclusion of the paper is devoted to a critique of the notion of truth in American pragmatism in that it ignores that possibility altogether.},

We have observed that the present error classification does not include all the errors. This paper extends the existing error classification (Inconsistency, Incompleteness and Redundancy) and provides a discussion about the consequences of these errors. We highlight the problems that we faced while developing our DKP-OM, ontology merging system and explain how these errors became obstacles in efficient ontology merging process. It integrates the ontological errors and design anomalies for content evaluation of ontologies under one framework. This framework helps ontologists to build semantically correct ontology free from errors that enables effective and automatic ontology mapping and merging with lesser user intervention.},

	Abstract = {The prospect of combining information from diverse sources for superior decision making is plagued by the challenge of semantic heterogeneity, as data sources often adopt different conventions and interpretations when there is no coordination. An emerging solution in information integration is to develop an ontology as a standard data model for a domain of interest, and then to define the correspondences between the data sources and this common model to eliminate their semantic heterogeneity and produce a single integrated view of the data sources. We first claim that this single integrated view approach is unnecessarily restrictive, and instead offer the view that ontologies can simultaneously accommodate multiple integrated views provided the accompaniment of contexts, a set of axioms on the interpretation of data allowing local variations in representation and nuances in meaning, and a conversion function network between contexts to reconcile contextual differences. Then, we illustrate how to achieve semantic interoperability between multiple ontology-based applications. During this process, application ontologies are aligned through the reconciliation of their context models, and a new application with a virtual merged ontology is created. We illustrate this alternative approach with the alignment of air travel and car rental domains, an actual example from our prototype implementation.},

PI is defined as the philosophical field concerned with the critical investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of information, including its dynamics, utilisation, and sciences, and the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to philosophical problems. I argue that PI is a mature discipline for three reasons: it represents an autonomous field of research; it provides an innovative approach to both traditional and new philosophical topics; and it can stand beside other branches of philosophy, offering a systematic treatment of the conceptual foundations of the world of information and the information society.},

This briefing is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context. It's an undeniable fact of life that people make mistakes. Some make more than others. Some mistakes are costlier than others. Just ask those companies that chose to dismiss the significance of the Internet when that phenomenon first emerged. Lessons are not always learned, unfortunately, and history may be in danger of repeating itself in the shape of web 2.0. With its focus on social networking capabilities, web 2.0 has transformed the online landscape to the extent that information sharing is now the norm for multitudes of people. Many companies, however, remain pretty skeptical about the implications of welcoming social networking tools into the workplace. The openness that characterizes this development goes against established principles, especially those founded on command and control. The article provides strategic insights and practical thinking that have influenced some of the world's leading organizations.} }

        Abstract = {This article first surveys the established views on Wittgenstein's relation to analytic philosophy. Next it distinguishes among different ways of defining analytic philosophy?topical, doctrinal, methodological, stylistic, historical, and the idea that it is a family-resemblance concept. It argues that while certain stylistic features are important, the historical and the family-resemblance conceptions are the most auspicious, especially in combination. The answer to the title question is given in section 3. Contrary to currently popular ?irrationalist? interpretations, Wittgenstein was an analytic philosopher in all phases of his career, albeit an exceedingly exotic one whose style transcends the limits of academic philosophy in general. On the historical understanding he qualifies because he was influenced by and in turn influenced mainly analytic philosophers. On the family-resemblance conception he qualifies both because he developed and employed logico-linguistic analysis and because he initiated the linguistic turn and the distinction between philosophy and science that characterizes one important strand in analytic philosophy.},

In this article we develop an alternative approach that does not impose such a strong dichotomy, but regards social and technical rather as dimensions along which to study workpractices. The developed theory involves not only the ``social'' and ``technical'' constructs, but also other generic ones, namely ``instrumental'', ``semiotic'', and ``pragmatic''. We call this theory socio-instrumental pragmatism. To illustrate the theoretical concepts introduced, we use an example brought from an extensive action research study including the development of an information system in eldercare, developed through a participatory design approach. },

@article{Harvey1997,
	Abstract = {Substantial changes in a core idea of geography, integration, have occurred since Alexander von Humboldt published Kosmos (1845--1862). These changes are part of a larger shift in Western civilization to mechanistic reasoning. This shift led to the strengthening of system-based analysis, central to the development of geographic information systems (GIS). The duality of holism and the systems approach has led to an apparent contradiction in geography. R. Hartshorne in The Nature of Geography described this contradiction, but as did Alfred Hettner and Emil Wisotzki before, moved to partial systems as the core concept of geographic integration. Hartshorne's concept of vertical integration is the antecedent for the ubiquitous GIS layer model. The reduction of geographic relationships and processes to mechanistic components (layers) aids the systematic approach, but may lessen geographic understanding of a place's interrelationships. Although the partiality of the system approach was already acknowledged by Finch and Hartshorne in the 1930s, the tension between holistic and system approaches in geography remains. Holism and system-based approaches are indeed complementary methods for developing geographic understanding. Using holistic approaches to understand geographic phenomena, before we teleologically (following a purpose) analyze phenomena as a system, extends GIS to include broader interrelationships of geography in specic locations.},

Design/methodology/approach -- First, outlines the historical development of these epistemologies, by discussing and identifying basic characteristics in them and by introducing the criticism that has been raised against these views. Second, their importance for and influence in LIS have been examined. \\
Findings -- The findings of this paper are that it is not a trivial matter to define those epistemologies and to characterise their influence. Many different interpretations exist and there is no consensus regarding current influence of positivism in LIS. Arguments are put forward that empiricism and positivism are still dominant within LIS and specific examples of the influence on positivism in LIS are provided. A specific analysis is made of the empiricist view of information seeking and it is shown that empiricism may be regarded as a normative theory of information seeking and knowledge organisation. \\
Originality/value -- The paper discusses basic theoretical issues that are important for the further development of LIS as a scholarly field.},

Their naturalism has been combined with an anti-foundationalist, holist account of meaning by Willard van Orman Quine, Hilary Putnam and Donald Davidson - philosophers of language who are often seen as belonging to the pragmatist tradition.

Multiple organizations, within a domain, often combine to work on specific projects. When separate organizations come together to communicate, an alignment of terminology and semantics is required. Ontology creation is often privatized for these individual organizations to represent their view of the domain. This creates problems with alignment and integration, making it necessary to consider how much each ontology should influence the current decision to be made. To assist with determining influence a trust-based approach on authors and their ontologies provides a mechanism for ranking reasoning results. A representation of authors and the individual resources they provide for the merged ontology becomes necessary. The authors are then weighted by trust and trust for the resources they provide the ontology is calculated. This is then used to assist the integration process allowing for an evolutionary trust model to calculate the level of credibility of resources. Once the integration is complete semantic agreement between ontologies allows for the revision of the authors' trust.},

	Abstract = {Semiotics includes discussions in the pragmatic dimension, the semantic dimension, and the syntactic dimensions to understand an intellectual individuals state of knowing and ways of obtain knowledge. The pragmatisms approach of how meanings are made and understood by consequences of an individuals actions with the surrounding environment and the triadic relation of three dimensions of sign coined by Peirce and Morris are considered applicable in theoretical modeling in many scientific fields such as linguistics, computer science, and human cognition. A semiotic view of information in the act of informing provides an approach of analysis that is useful for the studies of information behavior in the research of library and information science (LIS). Motivated by the lack of a general introduction to semiotics in the context of LIS for information behavior research, the author conducts a review of the ambiguity of information studies, the epistemological concerns and philosophical pragmatism in LIS, and semiotics in an attempt to seek a holistic foundation for LIS research in information behavior. By applying a semiotic view of information seeking activities, researchers of information behavior who focus on how people use linguistic and physical tools to access information will find semiotics a useful epistemological framework within LIS.},

It has an utmost relevance because action researchers are working with practitioners to solve the important practical problem. Design science outlined some years ago is just winning a wider audience. \\Action research was traditionally classified into qualitative research methods. But it seems to be the ``wrong'' home of action research. We shall show that after comparison of the seven aspects: concrete results of the study, knowledge produced, activities, the intent and the nature of a study, the division of labour in a study and generation, use and test of knowledge, the concordance between the characteristics of action research on the one hand and of design science on the other hand is very good. Hence, action research and design science should next be considered as similar research approaches, and this is a turning point in the history of both action research and design science.},

Information Systems researchers have spent considerable time exploring the impact and implications of these tools in organizations, but those same researchers have not spent sufficient time considering whether and how these new technologies may provide opportunities for us to reform our core practices of research, review, and teaching. To this end, this paper calls for the IS discipline to engage in two actions related to wikis and other Web 2.0 tools. First, the IS discipline ought to engage in critical reflection about how wikis and other Web 2.0 tools could allow us to conduct our core processes differently. Our existing practices were formulated during an era of paper based exchange; wikis and other Web 2.0 tools may enable processes that could be substantively better. Nevertheless, users can appropriate information technology tools in unexpected ways, and even when tools are appropriated as expected there can be unintended negative consequences. Any potential changes to our core processes should, therefore, be considered critically and carefully, leading to our second recommended action. We advocate and describe a series of controlled experiments that will help assess the impact of these technologies on our core processes and the associated changes that would be necessary to use them. We argue that these experiments can provide needed information regarding Web 2.0 tools and related practice changes that could help the discipline better assess whether or not new practices would be superior to existing ones and under which circumstances.},

The purpose of this study is three-fold. First, the primary goal is to propose a conceptual Web 2.0 framework that provides better understanding of the Web 2.0 concept by classifying current key components in a holistic manner. Second, using several selective key components from the conceptual framework, this study conducts case analyses of Web 2.0 applications to discuss how they have adopted the selective key features (i.e., participation, collaboration, rich user experience, social networking, semantics, and interactivity responsiveness) of the conceptual Web 2.0 framework. Finally, the study provides insightful discussion of some challenges and opportunities provided by Web 2.0 to education, business, and social life.},

There is a fairly consistent assumption running although debate on ISD methods; namely, that systems development is a cognitively intensive activity. But despite considerable study systems development remains a poorly understood activity. There is also evidence that, in practice, systems development projects are being approached from phenomenological pragmatism rather than from formally proposed teleological prescriptions, or ISD methods. That is, in practice ISD methods do not appear to be widely followed. This raises a question as to whether part of the reason lies in the training in formal ISD methods. Or phrased differently: what impact does formal development methods training have upon the cognitive development of systems developers. This research investigates one aspect of the relationship between the methodical training and the cognitive structure of novice systems developers, i.e. changes in a developer's cognitive complexity. The study suggests a cognitive growth cycle experienced by systems developers that underlies an informed method usage cycle.},

@article{Magani2004,
	Abstract = {Computational philosophy (CP) aims at investigating many important concepts and problems of the philosophical and epistemological tradition in a new way by taking advantage of information-theoretic, cognitive, and artificial intelligence methodologies. I maintain that the results of computational philosophy meet the classical requirements of some Peircian `pragmatic ambitions'. Indeed, more than a 100 years ago, the American philosopher C.S. Peirce, when working on logical and philosophical problems, suggested the concept of pragmatism (`pragmaticism', in his own words) as a logical criterion to analyze what words and concepts express through their practical meaning. Many words have been spent on creative processes and reasoning, especially in the case of scientific practices. In fact, many philosophers have usually offered a number of ways of construing hypotheses generation, but they aim at demonstrating that the activity of generating hypotheses is paradoxical, obscure, and thus not analyzable. Those descriptions are often so far from Peircian pragmatic prescription and so abstract to result completely unknowable and obscure. To dismiss this tendency and gain interesting insight about the so-called `logic of scientific discovery' we need to build constructive procedures, which could play a role in moving the problem-solving process forward by implementing them in some actual models. The `computational turn' gives us a new way to understand creative processes in a strictly pragmatic sense. In fact, by exploiting artificial intelligence and cognitive science tools, computational philosophy allows us to test concepts and ideas previously conceived only in abstract terms. It is in the perspective of these actual computational models that I find the central role of abduction in the explanation of creative reasoning in science. I maintain that the computational philosophy analysis of model-based and manipulative abduction and of external and epistemic mediators is important not only to delineate the actual practice of abduction, but also to further enhance the development of programs computationally adequate in rediscovering, or discovering for the first time, for example, scientific hypotheses or mathematical theorems. The last part of the paper is devoted to illustrating the problem of the extra-theoretical dimension of reasoning and discovery from the perspective of some mathematical cases derived from calculus and geometry.},

	Abstract = {Patterns of Cooperative Interaction are regularities in the organisation of work, activity, and interaction among participants, and with, through, and around artifacts. These patterns are organised around a framework and are inspired by how such regularities are highlighted in ethnomethodologically-informed ethnographic studies of work and technology. They comprise a high level description and two or more comparable examples drawn from specific studies. Our contention is that these patterns form a useful resource for reusing findings from previous field studies, for enabling analysis and considering design in new settings. Previous work on the relationship between ethnomethodology and design has been concerned primarily in providing presentation frameworks and mechanisms, practical advice, schematisations of the ethnomethodologist's role, different possibilities of input at different stages in development, and various conceptualisations of the relationship between study and design. In contrast, this article seeks to first discuss the position of patterns relative to emergent major topics of interest of these studies. Subsequently it seeks to describe the case for the collection of patterns based on findings, their comparison across studies and their general implications for design problems, rather than the concerns of practical and methodological interest outlined in the other work. Special attention is paid to our evaluations and to how they inform how the patterns collection may be read, used and contributed to, as well as to reflections on the composition of the collection as it has emerged. The paper finishes, first, with a discussion of how our work relates to other work on patterns, before some closing comments are made on the role of our patterns and ethnomethodology in systems design. },

@article{McGrath2005,
	Abstract = {For more than 30 years, critical research in information systems (IS) has challenged the assumption that technology innovation is inherently desirable and hence to the benefit of all. Nevertheless, how researchers view the nature of being critical has changed over time, and so too have the ways that they pursue their critical agenda and argue for their contributions. In this paper, I present a brief historical account of critical IS research, tracing the theoretical perspectives that have been dominant at different times and the empirical efforts that were guided by them. As part of tracing our current position I examine two key texts authored by Chrisanthi Avgerou and Geoff Walsham, who pursue different types of critical agenda and make distinctive empirically based contributions concerning the substantive issue of global diversity in IS innovation and its consequences. Overall, I suggest that the IS field now accepts broad definitions of the nature of being critical, but despite having a body of empirical critical research from which to learn, we are not making the most of our opportunities to do so, which retards further development. While I do not seek to develop a prescription for conducting and evaluating critical research, or try to encourage lengthy confessional accounts of research conduct in all journal papers, I do argue that we need more explicit reflections about our sustained long-term efforts in the field. Such reflections might consider the way we develop our critical arguments and insights, and what we strive for and accomplish through our interventions. In effect, the IS field has not yet reached a position where the theory and practice of doing critical research are informing each other.},

It involves the role of final ends in a philosophy that places practical reasoning at the heart of all knowledge. I will argue that while Dewey had powerful philosophical prejudices that prevented him from adequately dealing with this problem himself, a solution is nonetheless forthcoming that maintains, and perhaps to even deepens, the main themes of his pragmatism.

   Abstract = {Organizational adaptation to competition often means inventing or adopting a process innovation and the daunting challenge of implementing it. Increasingly, process innovations rely on the capabilities embedded in an organization's IT infrastructure. Successfully implementing an IT-enabled process innovation depends largely on how a project's IT and work process designs fit and evolve with this IT infrastructure. However, little empirical research guides the formulation of IT and work process strategies. This study addresses the question: How does the degree of coupling between a redesign project's IT strategy and work process strategy affect project performance? Data collection utilized a multistage research design employing comprehensive phone interviews and matched surveys among three sets of respondents (project managers, IT managers, and process users) across 43 process redesign projects in the health care industry. Our findings indicate project performance improves with tightly coupled IT and work process strategies when implementing process inventions, and with loosely coupled strategies when implementing imitations.},

Providing a rich description of micro-level, organizational,and macro-level events and techno-economic networks enabled us to depart from managerialist and technologist accounts of the failure. The analysis draws on constructivism and the sociology of technology, more specifically actor-network theory and the notions of symmetry and translation. An effort is made to combine elements of both the global and the local in identifying a series of translations occurring in the case study. To complement actor-network theory, a critical analysis is also necessary to examine how power relationships are creating disadvantage and can further explain failure. },

@article{Muddiman1999,
	Abstract = {Debates about the future of information and library education are often framed by assumptions about progress associated with a promised ``information society''. This paper presents an alternative perspective which characterises contemporary society as complex, fragmented and ``postmodern''. It suggests that conventional librarianship and information science are infused with ``modern'' concepts of enlightened social progress based on ``public knowledge'' and that they have thus found it difficult to adapt to such postmodern times. Information and library education has, as a result, become preoccupied with the ``management'' of information and knowledge and its associated technologies of performance maximisation. The paper argues that such a focus on information management needs to be balanced by new, reconceptualised information science curricula. Such curricula, it is claimed, need to be responsive to the flux and creative potential of the postmodern / networked age, but also underpinned by principles of humanism, empowerment and critical distance.},

  Title = {Developing a new key performance index for measuring service quality},
  Journal = {Industrial Management + Data Systems},
  Publisher = {Wembley},
  Year = {2010},
  Volume = {110},
  Number = {6},
  Page = {823},
  Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this research is to develop a new key performance index (KPI) and its interval estimation for measuring the service quality from customers' perceptions, since most service quality data follow non-normal distribution. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the non-normal process capability indices used in manufacturing industries, a new KPI suitable for measuring service quality is developed using Parasuraman's 5th Gap between customers' expectation and perception. Moreover, the confidence interval of the proposed KPI is established using the bootstrapping method. Findings - The quantitative method for measuring the service quality through the new KPI and its interval estimation is illustrated by a realistic example. The results show that the new KPI allows practising managers to evaluate the actual service quality level delivered within each of five SERVQUAL categories and prioritize the possible improvement projects from customers' perspectives. Moreover, compared with the traditional method of sample size determination, a substantial amount of cost savings can be expected by using the suggested sample sizes. Practical implications - The paper presents a structured approach of opportunity assessment for improving service quality from a strategic alignment perspective, particularly in the five dimensions: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. The new approach provides practising managers with a decision-making tool for measuring service quality, detecting problematic situations and selecting the most urgent improvement project. Once the existing service problems are identified and improvement projects are prioritized, it can lead to the direction of continuous improvement for any service industry. Originality/value - Given a managerial target on any desired service level as well as customers' perceptions and expectations, the new KPI could be applied to any non-normal service quality and other survey data. Thus, the corporate performance in terms of key factors of business success can also be measured by the new KPI, which may lead to managing complexities and enhancing sustainability in service industries.} }

This is a reflective or theoretical paper, which considers a number of research paradigms and traditions and explores the relevance of Critical Realism as an appropriate metatheory for IS Research.  This is not intended to be in any way a definitive description of these research traditions. Rather it is hoped that the paper will stimulate a discussion about the use of three different paradigms, and in doing so respond to the call for IS researchers to be more aware of the research methodological options available to them. The 
paper concludes by  proposing  that Critical Realism adds to the bouquet of philosophical choices available to the IS researcher, and that it is found to be an appropriate approach that transcends the critiques of both positivism and interpretivism.},

@book{Peirce1992,
           Abstract = {Interest in Peirce has grown enormously in recent years, and estimates of his significance as a thinker continue to run high. His work in logic, algebraical and graphical, has come to be regarded as substantial both for its historical impact and its enduring importance for research. Hilary Putnam expressed his surprise upon discovering "how much that is quite familiar in modern logic actually became known to the logical world through the efforts of Peirce and his students," (4) and W. V. Quine dates modern logic from "the emergence of general quantification theory at the hands of Frege and Peirce." (5) More recently, John Sowa has demonstrated how Peirce's graphical system of logic (his existential graphs) improves on other logics for the representation of discourse, and the study of language generally, and he has used the existential graphs as the logical foundation for his own conceptual graphs, "which combine Peirce's logic with research on semantic networks in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics." (6) In philosophy more generally, Peirce's work has been the focus of a considerable resurgence of interest throughout the world. This is demonstrated by the growing number of books and articles about Peirce, by increasing references to his ideas, and by the testimony of respected philosophers like Karl Popper, who regards Peirce as "one of the greatest philosophers of all time." (7) Finally, in the rapidly growing field of study known as semiotics, Peirce is universally acknowledged as one of the founders, even the founder, and his theory of signs is among the most frequently studied and systematically examined of all foundational theories. The importance of semiotics for all disciplines that deal crucially with representation (among them epistemology, linguistics, anthropology, and cognitive science, and probably all the fine arts) is only beginning to be recognized. In his 1989 Jefferson Lecture, Walker Percy argued that modern science is radically incoherent??"not when it seeks to understand things and subhuman organisms and the cosmos itself, but when it seeks to understand man, not man's physiology or neurology or his bloodstream, but man qua man, man when he is peculiarly human" --- but that, with his theory of signs, Peirce laid the groundwork for a coherent science of man that is yet to be worked out.(8)},

We present an approach to utility-based concept selection. Our approach is illustrated by a brief review of the relevant aspects of two existing frameworks for modelling of (software intensive) information systems and their architectures.

	abstract = {The semantic Web is the next step in the Internet's evolution. In order to facilitate autonomous information retrieval, it is necessary to create a standard framework for the semantic Web. The existing Web contains a considerable amount of data. It is an alluring target for data mining. Most of the data stored on Web pages is weakly structured. Mining or otherwise accessing the data in context from multiple sites is difficult; particularly when others construct the Web pages and their internal structure is not clearly understood. A standard way of viewing and organizing data into an ontology is essential for sharing data and interoperability between Web sites. A semantic Web standard has evolved through extensive iteration and was approved in late 2003. Fully autonomous or semi-autonomous discovery and development of ontologies is the only feasible way to transition to the semantic Web. One enabling strategy is to merge existing, vetted ontologies into a single ontology. The pre-merged ontologies would likely be similar in some respects and distinct in others. This paper discusses how to possibly merge multiple ontologies into a single viable ontology. It seeks an effective way to merge ontologies without losing any information (and possibly gaining some information in the process). When comparing ontologies, a similarity measure would be necessary. The measure would be used to measure the similarity two existing ontologies. This similarity measure is necessarily imprecise},

Both share an interest in interactivity, plurality, transience, and risk. This shared interest rejects the fundamental values of literacy and print identified by media theorists such as Walter J Ong, Eric Havelock, and Marshall McLuhan--autonomy, singularity, permanence, and security. The values of these mediums deeply impacted the development of Platonic Idealism and the Modern Enlightenment. My concluding argument suggests that, in the wake of these new mediums, the discipline of rhetoric and composition, in addition to the entire research University that houses it, should pay attention to how digital communities such as Wikipedia balance the Modern desire for ontological knowledge alongside the postmodern and digital emphasis on ethics. Such a balancing suggests that the primary values of literacy and print, and the institutions they helped to engender, are not ideally suited for a digital world.} }

   Abstract = {Computer-assisted software engineering (CASE) is viewed as a strategy to reduce development time, to cut maintenance costs, and to improve the discipline of information systems development. Yet, even with its many benefits, most organizations have found it difficult to implement CASE. Some of the obstacles to introducing CASE are cost, resistance by systems developers, and unacceptable learning curves. Two questions are examined: 1. What are the critical success factors in information systems analysis and design? 2. Do CASE tools support these critical success factors? The findings illustrate a discontinuity between the use of CASE and the achievement of critical success factors in systems development. It is found that for CASE to be effective, an organization may need to view information systems development as a work system.},

	Abstract = {Purpose -- To show that the neo-pragmatist position of Richard Rorty, when combined with a sociocultural perspective, provides library and information science (LIS) with a forceful epistemological tool. \\
Design/methodology/approach -- Literature-based conceptual analysis of: historical development of pragmatism in relation to other epistemological positions; neo-pragmatism as a non-dualist, both purpose and communication oriented, epistemology; and a sociocultural perspective within pedagogy, originated from the Russian researcher Lev Vygotsky. \\
Findings -- Brought together, a neo-pragmatist, sociocultural perspective contributes to a focus on people's actions through the use of linguistic and physical tools. As a tangible example of how neo-pragmatism can be applied as an epistemological tool within LIS, information seeking seen as communicative participation is discussed. This article unites a perspective on information seeking as communicative participation with the neo-pragmatist concepts of ``tools'' and ``communities of justification''. The article is concluded by an assessment of neo-pragmatism as an epistemological position within LIS, including those research issues that arise from this position and that are introduced along the way. \\
Practical implications -- In its focus on usability, the neo-pragmatist position provides a possible bridge between academic and other professional practices in the field of LIS. \\
Originality/value -- Provides, through the means of neo-pragmatism, an argument for the necessity of epistemological argumentation within LIS.},

A common theme found in the objections of Santayana's critics is that matter is ``unknowable''. After briefly out-lining Santayana's materialism and discussing his relationship to the pragmatist movement, four formulations of the ``unknowable'' objection are presented: (1) Matter is unknowable because it is not given in experience, (2) Matter is unknowable because its true nature cannot be revealed in perception, (3) Matter is unknowable because it has no properties, (4) Matter is unknowable because existence is a surd. It is argued that these objections are based in part on persistent misunderstandings of Santayana's materialism and that some of the more controversial aspects of his ontology are similar to ideas found in the writings of James and Peirce.},

There is no fine boundary of measurable variables that can be established to draw the line along which we can look at clear cut cause and effect relationships in either direction across that boundary. Any attempt to make either the social system or the technological system the independent or dependent variable is only a short term artifice that might very well give the wrong indicators of what is happening. Once this premise is accepted, one is led to the necessity of viewing the introduction of any new communication technology as a series of incremental and evolutionary experiments on a total system . Whether consciously or unconsciously done, the people involved, the social relationships, and the technology are all
design elements for the experiment . One cannot apply reductionist methods to the social studies of this area. \\

The Chinese philosophical concept of yin-yang is based on the belief that there are two complementary forces in the universe and one cannot be viewed as better than the other. Instead, they are both necessary, and a balance of both is what we should strive for. In regard to Web 2.0 and social networking technologies in the enterprise, this is exactly the paradigm in which it needs to start operating. The organization would likely fall behind its competitors in terms of achieving innovation, meeting customer demands, and taking advantage of efficiencies and new revenue streams. On the other extreme, consider the organization that deploys Web 2.0 and social networking technologies throughout the enterprise with few or no controls, policies, or guidance in place. The organization could well fall victim to an increased number of security attacks, see a decline in employee productivity, and/or find itself facing a barrage of HR and legal problems.

He defends the holistic view that scientific belief is tested by experience but that such testing is rightly applied to systems or conjunctions of beliefs, not isolated beliefs. He adds, however, that we test ethical systems by appealing to feelings of moral obligation as well as to sensory experiences.},

In one location after another, people are saying in effect: Let us take what exists now and restructure or replace it in digital format. Let's take the bank teller, the person sitting behind the counter with little scraps of paper and an adding machine and replace it with an ATM accessible 24 hours a day. Let's take analog recording and the vinyl LP and replace it with the compact disc in which music is encoded as a stream of digital bits. Or let's take the classroom with the teacher, blackboard, books, and verbal interchange and replace it with materials presented in computer hardware and software and call it ``interactive learning''. In case after case, the move to computerize and digitize means that many preexisting cultural forms have suddenly gone liquid, losing their former shape as they are retailored for computerized expression. As new patterns solidify, both useful artifacts and the texture of human relations that surrounds them are often much different from what existed previously. This process amounts to a vast, ongoing experiment whose long term ramifications no one fully comprehends. As they ponder astonishing transformations associated with the new electronics, thoughtful people need to ask: What kinds of personal practices, social relations, legal and political norms, and lasting institutions will emerge from this upheaval? More importantly, what kinds of practices, relations, rules, and institutions do we want to emerge in these settings. },
