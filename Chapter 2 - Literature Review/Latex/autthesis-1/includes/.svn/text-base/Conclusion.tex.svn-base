\nobreak
In chapter \ref{chap:intro} are stated the premise, plus concepts \cbstart{}that\cbend{} are touched on throughout the thesis. Then in chapter \ref{chap:litrev}, a review of literature relevant to the thesis is provided. In chapter \ref{chap:method} is an outline of the design of the study and the methodology applied, plus a rationale for why the method is used. Chapter \ref{chap:case} provides a real world perspective of the philosophical narrative with case studies and an overview of Web~2.0. In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, the notion of Work is detailed, and it's role in the life of the person. This leads on to chapter \ref{chap:production}, in which the dystopian notion of productionism is detailed. In chapter \ref{chap:democrat} the person enters the system \cbstart{}with the conception that the human is `part of the system,'\cbend{} powerless in the face of significant power asymmetries. \cbdelete{}In this chapter, the person is provided with the means to rebalance power asymmetries \cbstart{}with\cbend{} modern technologies (in the form of Web~2.0). 

\cbstart{}A\cbend{} shift in the balance of power provides the opportunity \cbstart{}for the redistribution of\cbend{} decision making roles. In chapter \ref{chap:socialisation}, this is taken up through the argument that Work, referenced as an objective notion while related to the worker, is thus reframed. \cbstart{}Thus, the\cbend{} scope for the socialisation of Work and is represented through a shift in attitude and intention in the worker, \cbstart{}is provided.\cbend{} Then, in chapter \ref{chap:evolution}, change as a subjective notion is presented, wherein the technological human represents the agent of change \cbstart{}in both\cbend{} itself and the worlds it occupies.

In chapter \ref{chap:semantics}, the question, \cbstart{}what are the semantics of Work in the Work System, is addressed through\cbend{} a series of semantic statements\cbdelete{} representing a systematic formal description of Work and the Work System.\cbdelete{} \cbstart{}In chapter \ref{chap:conclusion},\cbend{} the System, Work, and the Work System are described in natural language.\cbdelete{} The semantic ontology in \S\ref{sec:semantics:formal} is summarised, leading to a definition Work in the Work System in \S\ref{sec:conclusion:contribution}. The chapter then completes with areas of possible research in \S\ref{sec:conclusion:research}.


\section{Contribution to the field of \IS{}} \label{sec:conclusion:contribution}
\nobreak
In \S\ref{sec:conclusion:contribution}, the contribution to the field is presented as the definition of Work in the Work~System.

In this thesis I argue that the question, ``what are the semantics of Work in the Work System,'' must\cbdelete{} first \cbstart{}be\cbend{} addressed from the standpoint that Work is fundamental to the human and society.\footnote{`Must' is used to emphasise that Work is addressed as a human activity before consideration of applications. To do otherwise would assume that Work is \emph{a priori} and risk the imputation of differing definitions.} Thus, that Work is fundamental to the processes of building ideas into systems (both of thought and as operational processes). Further, this knowledge of Work addresses the seeming paradox in which technology has both served the human and how human serves the apparently endless desire to create new technology. In \S\S\ref{sec:production:dystopia}--\ref{sec:production:dystopiaIS} is highlighted the dystopian world the human has built for itself, quelling the human will to be of itself, instead being something artificial. \cbstart{}Nevertheless,\cbend{} the human spirit is not so easily crushed and that \cbstart{}with\cbend{} technology (such as Web~2.0), systems of social organisation and decision making (participatory democracy) are shown to successfully redistribute power. Power redistribution emerges as socialisation in the workplace and this signals change in how Work is perceived, especially for new entrants to the work place and who are familiar with the use of modern forms of technology. 

Therefore, it is proposed that Work is the means by which change is exercised upon an object where
that object may exist either spatiotemporally or as an abstraction. That Work, within a System, may effect changes to objects outside the System. Work in a System is any conception of Work that is limited to exertions of humans' $h$ or their extensions $h'$ within the bounds of a system. A task is the specific Work that is done by a human within the System, with or without the aid of technology, in order to make its intention real. Any task is spatiotemporally defined, may consist of sub-tasks, and may have dependencies for successful completion. 

Further, it is proposed that tasks, processes, and technology are properties of a Work System. In a Work System, Work is divided into tasks or processes where Work may be a planned process or task in the Work System or it may be ad-hoc. Any Work System may include single or multiple people, arranged as individuals or in groups, plus any supporting technology required to perform the Work. In a single Work System, all participants are related to all other participants through the Work that they do. The human-task-human relationship represents the socio-cultural context in which Work is done in the Work System. A Work System exists as a cultural artefact and is thus an object within a culture. Therefore, a Work System exists as a socio-cultural object in which technology is used to facilitate Work and Work that is facilitated by technology is an extension of the intention and purpose of the mind of the human. The purpose of a Work System, then, is that which is obtained by the human purpose and a Work System ought to have just one defined purpose. Where there are multiple purposes to be made manifest, or there are competing purposes, then there ought to be multiple Work~Systems.

This is a usual philosophical approach.\footnote{\pageref{semll6}:\ref{semll6}--\pageref{semll6a}:\ref{semll6a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{Throughout the thesis, selected themes are treated as abstract concepts. For example, the abstraction of human relations provides a means for modelling common understandings and behaviours.\footnote{\pageref{ll116}:\ref{ll116}--\pageref{ll116a}:\ref{ll116a}.} Abstraction permits the disclosure of meaning that might otherwise be locked in instantiations and the rearrangement of abstract forms allows different insights and perceptions to unfold.\footnote{\pageref{ll123}:\ref{ll123}--\pageref{ll125}:\ref{ll125}.  \pageref{ll248}:\ref{ll248}--\pageref{ll248a}:\ref{ll248a}.} A common theme is that nature is regarded as an object of knowledge that represents aspirational human properties.\footnote{\pageref{prodll108}:\ref{prodll108}--\pageref{prodll108a}:\ref{prodll108a}} However, through science, humanity has exercised its dominance over nature; as the progenitor of humanity. Thus, this has enabled humanity to build a rational existence based on scientific discovery, supplanting nature as irrational.\footnote{\pageref{prodll40b}:\ref{prodll40b}--\pageref{prodll40c}:\ref{prodll40c}. \pageref{socll54}:\ref{socll54}--\pageref{socll54a}:\ref{socll54a}.} There, as an object of knowledge, nature has had change effected upon it and this is reflected in humanity.\footnote{\pageref{ll89}:\ref{ll89}--\pageref{ll91}:\ref{ll91}. \pageref{ll338}:\ref{ll338}--\pageref{ll338a}:\ref{ll338a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{As an entity, the human has the property of mind and it is a function of the mind to categorise and organise abstract objects. The creation of abstract forms and their relationships arises from internal and external stimuli.\footnote{\pageref{socll80}:\ref{socll80}--\pageref{socll80a}:\ref{socll80a}. } Objectification is a fluid idea that ranges in scope from the individual and unique, to encompass very large groups and clusters.

\ColourTextRed{Nature has mechanism. Therefore, nature is observable, predictable (to a degree), but (as stated earlier) nature is irrational where rationality is a process of the human mind.

\ColourTextRed{In the field of \IS{}, the concept of Work and the Work System are rational and \emph{a priori}.\footnote{\pageref{ll63}:\ref{ll63}--\pageref{ll63a}:\ref{ll63a}. \pageref{ll55}:\ref{ll55}--\pageref{ll55a}:\ref{ll55a}.} That is, the meaning of Work and systems have been transferred from the industrial setting to computing, with the result that the \IT{} artefact is regarded as the most important object. However, modern information systems are held to be abstractions of the material worlds. Modern systems blur the lines between the social, moral, ethical, psychic, and motive. In this thesis, a distinction is made between the rationalism of productionism and the irrational appearance of the natural human. Therefore, the transformation of objective Work from \emph{a priori} to one that finds its epistemological foundations in \IS{} requires formal definition of the term.\footnote{\pageref{ll57}:\ref{ll57}--\pageref{ll62}:\ref{ll62}. \pageref{ll97}:\ref{ll97}--\pageref{ll97a}:\ref{ll97a}.} }

\ColourTextRed{The \IT{} artefact, Web~2.0, has been selected as a representation of an influential and widespread occurrence of a collection of modern information and communication technologies.

\ColourTextRed{The artefact is treated throughout the thesis as an abstraction, except in those instances where examples are used to illustrate certain points.

\section{Areas for further research} \label{sec:conclusion:research}
\nobreak
\subsection{The philosophy of \IS{}} \label{sec:conclusion:research:philosophy}
\nobreak
Establishing the semantics of Work in the Work System provides a platform for the development of a holistic philosophy of \IS{}. The thesis touches on important concepts about the Work System, by necessity focussing on an area that is tightly focussed and distinct from other conceptions. This leaves a wealth of epistemic notions within \IS{} that are effectively \emph{a priori} are assumed to have valid epistemological and ontological foundations, but that have not been sufficiently tested through critical enquiry or their foundations clarified. Building on the approach taken in this thesis, other assumed objects of knowledge can be investigated and defined in relation to \IS{}, with the ultimate aim of building a philosophy of \IS{} that are unique and provide for the field, epist\'{e}mi.

Thus, this thesis forms a part of a larger body of thought and application that requires investigation and discussion. At this time, there are seemingly divergent schools of thought within the field and that creates a problem for practitioners, researchers, and students.\footnote{\cbstart{}For example, page \pageref{text:intro:footnote:theories}, footnote \ref{text:intro:footnote:theories}.\cbend{}} While it is unlikely that there will a point at which all will agree, there still needs to a core set of knowledge objects. Examples of those that need further investigation are: the concept that the information system is a technological artefact, whether \IS{} should remain within the realm of business schools and colleges or if the spread of systems that thread throughout society means that \IS{} has outgrown that.\cbdelete{}

Additional to this is the question of research approach and method versus some other approach the building of knowledge in the field. It has been apparent in the performance of this thesis that the field has become fixated on method and is thus defined by Nietzsche's condemnation that ``it is not the victory of science that distinguishes our [field], but the victory of scientific method over science'' \cite[p. 262]{Nietzsche1968}. On the one hand the field falls victim to its own preoccupation with methodological solutions to questions where the answer to a question is as important as the methods selected to find it, and on the other the field must find itself through the creation of its own methodological approaches to finding answers to questions. Through the development of a heuristic-based approach to a philosophy of \IS{}, the field has built a solid core of epist\'{e}mi that is further protected by a phalanx of ancillary theories~\cite{Lakatos1970}.\footnote{For example, see \citeA{Litchfield2011}.} \cbstart{}Extending \citeauthor{Lakatos1970} \emph{in reductio};\cbend{} in the first instance researchers approach all problems with the same myopic set of possible `solution-finders,' their methods, and in the second, a well tested structure of methods protects the field from the nihilistic vicissitudes of errant researchers.

\subsection{Identification of epist\'{e}mi} \label{sec:conclusion:research:identification}
\nobreak
In this thesis, Work \cbstart{}is\cbend{} chosen as the epist\'{e}m\'{e} for the reason that it is a central part of the life of the person and that it is something that sets the human apart from other known life forms.\footnote{As it was said in footnote \ref{sec:intro:premise:footnote} on p. \pageref{sec:intro:premise:footnote}, ``Work is not done by a dog because the dog does not engage faculties of conscious determination and mind to order its surroundings.''} \cbstart{}Other objects of knowledge exist. These\cbend{} ought to be formally defined in light of their present and future use.\cbdelete{} The implications of data and information collection and use \cbstart{}need updating. There have been\cbend{} attempts to place controls \cbstart{}such as\cbend{} patents, copyright laws, and corporate policies.\cbdelete{} The human-computer interface\cbdelete{} is undergoing significant change; \cbdelete{}how it exists in the mind the person needs to be better understood. \cbstart{}The definition of\cbend{} an enterprise system; whereas enterprise systems are historically relatively well defined in terms of function and scope, with the increased adoption of widely distributed and outsourced applications and platforms, how such systems are defined needs to be readdressed.

The field is large and widespread and there \cbstart{}exist\cbend{} other possible epist\'{e}mi \cbstart{}to\cbend{} be identified. The rationale for picking on each will vary according to its present application and environment. \cbdelete{}Once each has been identified, then it is subject to redefinition as its circumstances change. The approach to each object will\cbdelete{} be dependent upon the context in which it is found. 

At this time it is proposed that all objects within \IS{} are subject to investigation. All objects of knowledge in \IS{} are socially produced and as socially-mediated worlds change, then so too must those objects that were produced from them if they are to remain relevant and integrated. Such work is the work of the philosopher, and together they go to build a philosophy of \IS{}. There is a vast scope of possible development within which rational argumentation is applied to objects of knowledge in \IS{}.

\subsection{Further development of logics in \IS{}} \label{sec:conclusion:research:logic}
\nobreak
To test the statements in \S\ref{sec:semantics:formal} and to build philosophical foundations in the field of \IS{}, further investigations will be focussed on two areas: 
\begin{enumerate*}
\item The semantic statements in \S\ref{sec:semantics:formal} open the pathway for extensions into the considerations of the semantics of data management, for example, to build a relational logic that enables cloud-based databases to efficiently transact queries and analytics from cloud-based applications. Thus, resolving the dilemma that relational databases on ``the cloud'' require excessive transactional overhead. That relational databases on ``the cloud'' means they are widely distributed through networks and this adds latency to the flow of data that impedes transaction performance. 
\item To find semantic notations that represent core statements or objects of knowledge within \IS{}. The event type reification of temporal logic applied in this thesis may not be applicable in all circumstances and it may be necessary to find those languages that are. To test the statements, in a pragmatic sense, requires that the abstract notions in \S\ref{sec:conclusion:intro} are conceived through experimentation and experience \cite{Peirce1992a}, thus one is then able to classify them according to the predefined criteria in \S\S\ref{sec:semantics:work}--\ref{sec:semantics:formal}. This approach provides the opportunity to develop both logical formalisms and methods for experimentation.
\end{enumerate*}

\subsection{The impact of Web~2.0 technologies on Work} \label{sec:conclusion:research:Web}
\nobreak
In \S\ref{sec:socialisation:worker}, the worker is reframed by the Work that they do when they are given the opportunity to build a socialised workplace, in this case through the application of Web~2.0 technologies. This in turn creates a new definition of Work and in turn, implies that the aims and intentions of the worker shift when they are given technological tools that enable them to reframe their existence. Thus, it may be demonstrated that Web~2.0 technologies can have significant impact on Work. However, it is a theory that has yet to be tested in any meaningful and practical way. While formalisms have been developed in \S\ref{sec:semantics:formal}, these now need to be measured empirically.

The formalisms in \S\ref{sec:semantics:formal} have been expressed as a definition in \S\ref{sec:conclusion:contribution}. These provide the basis for hypotheses that will be subject to validation or rejection and \citeA{Lakatos1970} says they must be severely tested, if they are to be accepted as core theory in \IS{}. The approach for testing ought to be, where possible, quantitative and as stated, empirical, \cbstart{}which\cbend{} satisfies \cbdelete{}the philosophical pragmatist. However, theories also include metaphysical notions that the person is the embodiment of personality, will, soul, spirit, mind, emotion, and intelligence.\footnote{See \S\ref{sec:intro.human}.}\cbdelete{} Thus, they become a challenge to the methodological positivist and the socio-materialist, who envisages that systems are the temporary, interstitial, representations of the technological artefact.\cbdelete{}

\subsection{The influence of technologies on the lives of people} \label{sec:conclusion:research:influence}
\nobreak
While possibly fitting in line with aspects of Human Computer Interaction, that technology influences the lives of humans, also brings into question the ethics of \IS{} development and the effects that \IS{} applications have on the person and society. Examples of the ethical use of systems emerge in such groups as SIGGreen, whose aim is to build an ecologically sustainable society \cbstart{}with\cbend{} information technology. However, as an aspect of research there must be an empirical set of methods that measurably demonstrate the nature and extent of influence that technology has on the lives of the person and society as a whole.

While numerous examples of applications of technology during episodes of societal upheaval may be cited, the question of whether the relationship between technology and societal upheaval is causative is not so easily demonstrated. Take the proposition: \cbdelete{}technology causes change in society. \cbstart{}Further, if it is true that technology has a causative relationship on the person and then it is true that technology has a causative relationship on society (with the assumption that a society represents a collection of individuals whose relationships with each other presuppose that a technological influence is possible). It must hold that if the question is true, then it is true that there is some state change that is measurable in the person because of their interacting with technology. \cbend{}

However, it is not sufficient for change in the person to be short-lived, momentary, or transitory. Nor is change something that culminates in a state that is naturally occurring, such as feelings of joy, anger, satisfaction and adequacy.\cbdelete{} It is not sufficient for the change to be simply represented as a change in view or perception. Change needs to be of a more permanent or long lasting nature. It needs to produce a change-state that is new or not previously observed in the person or societal group. The change-state needs to be distinguishable from other states and it needs to be shown that the state could not have arisen from other interactions or sources. The change-state may have physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual characteristics. Thus, to perform such a test satisfies the demands of the philosophical pragmatist provided the experiments do not exclude metaphysical phenomena. 

A change-state may occur rapidly and hold permanently, it may occur rapidly and hold for a short period but repeated iterations of the change-state result in a semi-permanent or long term change, or it may occur slowly but with the two variations of holding intermittently or permanently. A method that incorporates processes capturing these phenomena needs to be identified. The selection of method will depend upon the technology identified and that is compatible with both the change that is expected to occur and to meet the specific characteristics of the person or society that is the subject of the experiment. To apply such an experiment to a societal mix provides significant scope for poor application of method and misinterpretation of data. Such an experiment must be conceived with care and validated on execution.
 
\section{Conclusion}
\nobreak
Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} highlights that \IS{} is a field that is firmly tied to the human and that the human lives a life that is socio-technologically mediated. In \S\ref{sec:conclusion:contribution}, the definition of Work in the Work System is provided. The definition \cbdelete{}provides scope for further research in \S\ref{sec:conclusion:research}. \cbstart{}Expanding\cbend{} from this thesis and \cbstart{}continuing\cbend{} to build a philosophy of \IS{}, which means identifying specific areas within the field and defining them as epist\'{e}mi, building a language of logic to define the semantics of \IS{} epist\'{e}mi, testing the logic in real-world cases, and determining the extent of the influence of the epist\'{e}mi.
