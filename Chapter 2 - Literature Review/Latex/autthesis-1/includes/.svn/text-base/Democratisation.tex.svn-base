\section{Introduction}
\nobreak
In chapter \ref{chap:production}, I argued the part that productionist metaphysics has played in the evolution of the technological human. To summarise, the meaning of `produce' and `production' has changed so that for the `ancient Greeks,' `production' and `making' was the means by which products \cbstart{}change\cbend{} be released from their source, disclosively. `Production' employed in modern industrial technology, on the other hand, is the result of industrial processes in which `product' is the result of rational processes. The rationalisation employed by the technological human masks a purposelessness that is represented by a movement away from the disclosiveness of `production,' and towards a manifestation of the Will to Will, where the technological system strives for ever greater production for its own sake. A differentiation is then made between what is art appearing through disclosure, and products that are manufactured through an industrial process. 

\textls[8]{It was argued that the technological system is based on an economic model, whereas what was previously the case for pre-industrial humanity, \cbstart{}`production'\cbend{} was determined by nature's exigencies rather than the exchange value of goods and services. The result of the transformation of the human from living a natural existence to existing in the industrial complex has created an abstract technological world. However the technological world masks the purposelessness of `production' and therefore, those tasked with producing have no purpose either. It is in this state of perpetuated production fulfilling the Will to Will, that the technological human's sense of self and itself are abdicated. It is more important in this new reality to Work to enhance the power of the technological world, than it is to contribute to the well-being of humanity. Therefore, the technological human, to find any benefit in the technological world, must come to terms with this new reality and accept that it is little more than a particle in the juggernaut.\footnote{See the comment in footnote \ref{text:litrev:juggernaut} on p. \pageref{text:litrev:juggernaut}.} }

Thus, in chapter \ref{chap:production}, I have argued that to come to terms with the juggernaut, as the `system,' the technological human is required to incorporate technological developments into all aspects of its life, personal and Work. The technological system is, for the technological human, its new natural state and developments such as Web 2.0 provide an interface where the technological human begins to regain its sense of self, its beingness, and a return to its own Will. `Production' in the Web 2.0 space is irrational in the sense that producing art is irrational; `production' is a disclosure that provides the means of escape from productionist metaphysics. In so doing, the technological human recaptures the sense of community it lost when it became the innocent on the urban shore. The technological human re-negotiates the moral and social boundaries of its societal existence through \cbstart{}reconnection to the values, norms and mores that had been forgotten under productionism.\cbend{}

Therefore, chapter \ref{chap:production} concludes with the notion that Web 2.0 confounds political and economic models, based on nineteenth and twentieth century ideals. The individual is king, not compacts, and the crowd is an alignment of viewpoints, desires, wants, needs, social ties, political positions, and so on. Such alignments may shift and in the Web 2.0 space, they often do. The concept of the wisdom of the crowds, when applied to Work, brings forth the expectation in the person that they may choose to align themselves with certain policies in the workplace, or they may choose to partake of specific Work practices because they bring about positive change. The Web 2.0 phenomenon allows the technological human to participate in decision making processes in Work and so Web 2.0 facilitates the democratisation of Work.

In chapter \ref{chap:democrat}, I bring the arguments in chapter \ref{chap:production} forward, by putting under scrutiny the role that democratisation has in redefining Work from its source in productionist metaphysics, while under the influence of Web 2.0. In \S\ref{sec:democrat:asymetry}, the process how democratisation of Work as a shift in the asymmetric distribution of power in the enterprise, is explicated, as is the role of the technological human in the enterprise who has access to mechanisms and processes, and has greater participation in formative decision making. 

In \S\ref{sec:democrat:participation}, I argue for the concept of participatory democracy, particularly in relation to its application in what are typically understood to be autocratic organisational structures found in businesses and enterprises. I present the argument that early information systems, those that were designed to replicate work practices found in enterprises, were conceived as automation machines, separated physically, emotionally, and psychologically from the systems operator. That information systems stood apart from the operator as machines in the workplace, and the operators of them, were regarded only as the end-users of the system. 

\cbstart{}It is shown in \S\ref{sec:democrat:IS},\cbend{} that through democratisation of work practices and decision-making through power sharing, and where end-users have the capability to adapt systems to suit individual requirements, then these same operators or end-users are now more properly regarded as `participants' in the system. `Participants' are not just operators or end-users of information systems, therefore. They engage with information systems to perform Work, as it is required of them. Work is purposeful directed action, but since the purposes for which Work is undertaken is mutable, so too is Work. This then means \newpage{}\noindent{}that the natural state of the human is reframed to include the technological human and the `participant' is the naturalised technological human.

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:litrev}, humanity sacrificed its Dasein to have security inside the technological system. This position is extended in chapter \ref{chap:production}: that technological humanity's sense of security is both found in the rationalisation of natural phenomena and finding for the irrational, some use or purpose. However, in chapter \ref{chap:notion}, security is also presented as a resistor to change, particularly in the enterprise where systems are entropic. In chapter \ref{chap:democrat}, a further dimension to security is added wherein the technological human gets, for the price of its Dasein, admittance to subjugation through the asymmetrical distribution of power in the enterprise.\footnote{\pageref{demoll28}:\ref{demoll28}--\pageref{demoll28a}:\ref{demoll28a}. \pageref{demoll166f}:\ref{demoll166f}--\pageref{demoll166g}:\ref{demoll166g}. } Further, in chapter \ref{chap:production}, reference is made of the millions of internally displaced persons who washed up on the shores of the industrial complex. The combined effect of being ripped apart from their roots and in finding themselves in an unfamiliar matrix of asymmetric power distribution, workers tried to form mutually supporting social organisations: trade unions.\footnote{\pageref{demoll42}:\ref{demoll42}--\pageref{demoll42a}:\ref{demoll42a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{Thus, the first new argument in chapter \ref{chap:democrat} is: that technological humanity is not a homogeneous group, nor is the institutions it created. Therefore, power asymmetries will be correspondingly diverse.\footnote{\pageref{demoll30}:\ref{demoll30}--\pageref{demoll30a}:\ref{demoll30a}. \pageref{demoll49}:\ref{demoll49}--\pageref{demoll49a}:\ref{demoll49a}.} Further, while the motivation for maintaining power asymmetry emerges from the need to ensure that decisions are made and instructions are carried out,\footnote{\pageref{demoll40}:\ref{demoll40}--\pageref{demoll40a}:\ref{demoll40a}.} unfettered facilitation has provided the opportunity for some to obtain apparently limitless power.\footnote{\pageref{demoll40b}:\ref{demoll40b}--\pageref{demoll40c}:\ref{demoll40c}.} Additionally, technological humanity, disenfranchised, seeks confirmation and recognition as much as security. Engagement in the decision making process authenticates the existence of the person, so that the person may be recognised. Further engagement confirms status and power within the enterprise.\footnote{\pageref{demoll58}:\ref{demoll58}--\pageref{demoll58a}:\ref{demoll58a}. } Where this is prevented or refused, the person may opt for unresponsiveness, ambiguity, or contrariness.\footnote{\pageref{demoll71}:\ref{demoll71}--\pageref{demoll71a}:\ref{demoll71a}. \pageref{demoll198}:\ref{demoll198}--\pageref{demoll198a}:\ref{demoll198a}. }}

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:democrat}, the second new argument is: whereas promises of rationality, purpose, security and freedom from the irrationality of nature have attracted the technological human to productionism, technological humanity is repressed through enterprise autocracy. However, participative democratic processes allow a greater freedom than that offered. Such freedom demands engagement and the technological human must face moral and ethical choices that had previously been decided for it. However, the possibility of success is improved in a heterogeneous population.\footnote{\pageref{demoll74}:\ref{demoll74}--\pageref{demoll74a}:\ref{demoll74a}. }}

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:production}, technological humanity is counselled to come to terms with the juggernaut and to regain the sense of self by addressing the knowledge that technological humanity never lost it. In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, the argument is presented that creativity, as a property of the person, cannot be extinguished and therefore provides a means for obtaining mastery over the juggernaut (the technological system). In chapter \ref{chap:democrat}, I extend that argument: that participatory democracy provides a mechanism for self determination and thus, mastery over the juggernaut.\footnote{\pageref{demoll112}:\ref{demoll112}--\pageref{demoll112a}:\ref{demoll112a}. \pageref{demoll117}:\ref{demoll117}--\pageref{demoll120}:\ref{demoll120}.}}

\ColourTextRed{The third new argument is presented in chapter \ref{chap:democrat}: that usually, when a technological artefact requires definition, it is defined by technologists against a technical framework of understanding.\footnote{\pageref{demoll140}:\ref{demoll140}--\pageref{demoll140a}:\ref{demoll140a}.} Then, when problems are identified, they are framed so that the solution will be technical in nature. I argue that this approach selectively excludes natural phenomena and ensures the technological system remains in supremacy\footnote{\pageref{demoll140b}:\ref{demoll140b}--\pageref{demoll140c}:\ref{demoll140c}.} and any natural phenomena that are included must be described in technological terms.\footnote{\pageref{demoll140d}:\ref{demoll140d}--\pageref{demoll140e}:\ref{demoll140e}.} Therefore, the technological system exists through a process of selected cause and influence\footnote{\pageref{demoll161}:\ref{demoll161}--\pageref{demoll161a}:\ref{demoll161a}.} and all of humanity that is encompassed by the technological system is of the standing reserve, regardless of rank or function.\footnote{\pageref{demoll169}:\ref{demoll169}--\pageref{demoll169a}:\ref{demoll169a}. }} 

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:democrat}, I reconceptualise Heidegger's standing reserve as data.\footnote{\pageref{demoll166}:\ref{demoll166}--\pageref{demoll166a}:\ref{demoll166a}.} In its reduced state, the technological human performs functions on data, using the information system as a machine for ordering the standing reserve: the data.\footnote{\pageref{demoll166b}:\ref{demoll166b}--\pageref{demoll166c}:\ref{demoll166c}. \pageref{demoll192b}:\ref{demoll192b}--\pageref{demoll192c}:\ref{demoll192c}.} However, while the technological human is called upon to be human, a problem is disclosed. The technological human is so much part of the technological system that when the technological human is called upon to reveal its Dasein: is it the technological system reveals its essence or the technological human?\footnote{\pageref{demoll166d}:\ref{demoll166d}--\pageref{demoll166e}:\ref{demoll166e}.} The nature of humanity is to connect and as part of the technological system, technological humanity connects not just as a supplicant to the machine but also as controller. The equalising force of the connection enables technological humanity to adopt the essence of the system and to enframe it. Altering the technological system gives humanity the advantage.\footnote{\pageref{demoll196}:\ref{demoll196}--\pageref{demoll196a}:\ref{demoll196a}. }}

\ColourTextRed{Further, in chapter \ref{chap:democrat}, I assert that engagement with the technological system provides the technological human an opportunity to disclose the system's essence, and allow the technological human to gain mastery over it.\footnote{\pageref{demoll202}:\ref{demoll202}--\pageref{demoll202a}:\ref{demoll202a}.} This is an important distinction with Heidegger. He wrote at a time when the machine was huge and monstrous and created a blot on the horizon. The technological system of today is writ in the small. It is ubiquitous, and as part of the juggernaut, it is vast and inescapable. There is no opportunity to reject the system where all are born into the technological age. Thus, the only opportunity that presents itself is to become of the system, and gain mastery over its essence. A key to engagement in participation comes from the education of the person and creating an environment that is enriching. When the person becomes part of a greater social organisation, other opportunities for enrichment and learning present themselves.\footnote{\pageref{demoll206}:\ref{demoll206}--\pageref{demoll206a}:\ref{demoll206a}.} The mechanism of communication technologies provides opportunities for engagement and learning by positively affirming acceptable behaviour.\footnote{\pageref{demoll209}:\ref{demoll209}--\pageref{demoll209a}:\ref{demoll209a}.} In addition, deliberation through communications technologies strengthens inter-group relations\footnote{\pageref{demoll212}:\ref{demoll212}--\pageref{demoll212a}:\ref{demoll212a}.}}

\section{Asymmetric power} \label{sec:democrat:asymetry}
\nobreak
\linelabel{demoll28}Power asymmetry exists for any person whose existence is within \cbstart{}the artificiality of a hierarchical organisational structure and its authority.\cbend{} Thus, power asymmetry exists for the technological human. Specifically, the technological human abdicated its responsibility to self, when it \cbstart{}adopted\cbend{} a servile existence inside that of the `systems' Will. The technological human traded its will for a sense of security and, paradoxically, independence. This independence afforded to the technological human takes the appearance of seemingly major and important decisions, while truly life-affecting choices are made by `authorities' and are outside its control.\linelabel{demoll28a}

\linelabel{demoll30}Asymmetry of power in human relations takes various forms. Typically, it refers to differences in the power relationship between parties (say between management and employees in an enterprise), but from there it becomes more difficult to define because\cbdelete{} power is perceived or exercised varies.\linelabel{demoll30a} \cbdelete{}Investigations will lead one through a maze of management, political science, sociological, and psychological domains, each of whom use their own epistemological frameworks and language to refer to similar, naturally occurring phenomena in human interactions. For example,

\begin{quotation}
\noindent{}\dots{}under management's asymmetric power, co-operative practices paternalistically alter workers' descriptive perception of workplace reality or their normative sense of their own preferences and interests in ways that serve managerial interests. The proposition, in the argot of economists and cognitive psychologists, is that capital suppliers' managerial agents, acting either in the distributive interests of their principals or in their independent interest in managerial control, use their bargaining power to generate ``endogenous'' changes in the ``preferences'' or ``perceptual frame'' of weaker contracting parties. Stated in the terminology of critical theory, employers exercise domination over workers through ``hegemonic'' transformations in worker consciousness or ideology, either as an alternative or a supplement to coercive forms of control. In lay terms, co-operative schemes ``co-opt'' workers. That is, such schemes do deflect workers' group choice over workplace governance modes, and in a systematic direction --- away from the full collective bargaining that the New Deal policy equates with objective ``industrial democracy.'' \hfill{}\citeA[p.~762]{Barenberg1994}
\end{quotation}

Power asymmetries are viewed across lines such as race, gender, class and position, access to authority and information, economic power, social and political influence, degrees or lack of respect~\cite{Barenberg1994,Bowman2007}. 

\linelabel{demoll40}\cbstart{}Asymmetrical power within the enterprise emerges\cbend{} from the need of management to ensure compliance for decisions that have been made.\linelabel{demoll40a} To make decisions palatable, they are cast in ``the dual language of instrumental discipline and non-instrumental consent or commitment''~\cite[p.~771]{Barenberg1994}. \linelabel{demoll40b}This was especially true in the 1930s, at the height of the machine age where the technological system was in its ascendency, and fears of the cybernetic human were promulgated. Managers were under intense pressure from mass labour unrest and political challenges to their apparently limitless managerial authority, to adopt approaches that revealed a greater sense of moral authority, while the union movement had already become politicised.\linelabel{demoll40c} \citeA{Vallas1999} refers to a manifestation of productionist metaphysics in industry as `Fordism.' Taylorist principles had been universally adopted into the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in the United States by the second decade of the twentieth century, and this created a technological system that had inculcated related industries. \citeA{Prichard1999} suggests that the industrialisation of Western society produced anxiety in workers \cite<a  point supported by>{Tannenbaum1952} and that a defensive reaction was to pursue strategies of control that would secure the identity of the controlling groups. The result was, rather than the emancipation of humankind, that power relationships that had existed before industrialisation were reproduced within the framework of industry and enterprises individually.

\linelabel{demoll42}For the reasonable person, it is a fantasy to suppose that any enterprise might exist without some degree of power differential, and it is a characteristic of human nature to order itself and its world into ranking systems and hierarchies.\footnote{Refer also to the discussion on the Aristotelian perception of hierarchy on p. \pageref{text:notion:aristotle}.} However, the industrial system stripped the individual worker of their `natural' place in society. Whereas pre-industrial humanity lived by values that were attached to their society before, within the technological system, ordinary meanings that make life acceptable had evaporated. To fill the void, illegitimate means for the attribution of power advantages were built, such as the `company union.' \cbstart{}\citeA{Barenberg1994} says the `company union' is, in some jurisdictions, a lawful body formed within and sanctioned by the company. It was\cbend{} created to replicate the naturally forming society, which the dislocated worker craved. The industrial juggernaut \cbstart{}had\cbend{} destroyed societal frameworks so workers sought to form their own social units, based on their occupational employment:\linelabel{demoll42a} these became `trade unions.'  \cbstart{}The worker\cbend{} needed a place to stand.\footnote{In the \maori{} language \emph{turangawaewae} or \emph{home ground} represents a place to call home and \emph{ursprung} or arising. It is a bastion to be defended and fought for when the need arises. It is the first and last place of being. It often imbues a physical setting with an emotional and spiritual sense of connectedness and belonging.} \cbstart{}However,\cbend{} the `company union' was a reaction against \cbstart{}trade unions\cbend{} and invoked practices that transformed workers' consciousness of what they ought to desire and be interested in, how they ought to react and behave, and how they ought to work to safeguard the future of the company~\citeyear{Barenberg1994}. The principal aim of the `company union' was to place the interests of management and worker in phase with each other.

If management seeks to put workers in phase with its decisions then it needs to have a means of controlling responses in given situations. Asymmetric information distribution has been used as a deliberate ploy in industry. For example, \citeA{Barenberg1994} says the company union has been used to create a conditioned employee representative. The union representative would be bombarded with company-biased information and arguments about workers' performance, but at the same time, making certain that the representative was well aware of their favoured status and apparent role of building solidarity. However, the representative would likely also begin to regard themselves as part of the management team and its machinery just through constant exposure on a cordial basis. To the representative, rank in a status hierarchy is addictive and since the effects of largesse wear off quickly, greater degrees of satisfaction are called for, but the greater pain is loss of status. To assuage the pain, the representative is increasingly likely to seek to find favour with management through the demonstration of information asymmetries over their peers.

That a condition of asymmetric power distribution exists between authorities and subordinates, according to \citeA{Barenberg1994}, is not necessarily a function of coercion or normative consent. Compliance may just as well be a result of apathy, resignation, unconscious habit or custom, emotional patterns of coping or compulsion, or behavioural or psychic diversions and displacements. \cbstart{}Compliance\cbend{} may have been produced from an abstract political stance taken by either the employer or the union, for example liberalism or socialism. \cbstart{}Compliance\cbend{} may also be the technological system's representatives expressing their demand to manifest its Will, in effect, as the result of  ``the pre-reflective dispositions and discursive performances, the inarticulate, spontaneous practices and emotions that suffuse everyday experience''~\citeyear[p.~813]{Barenberg1994}. With the loss of social context referred to by \citeA{Tannenbaum1952}, \citeauthor{Barenberg1994} says that his views direct the focus towards the local social contexts that encompass the daily experience of the worker and mediates between them, the enterprise, and other individuals they interact with. He cites as an example, the process of naturalisation in which a new subordinate is introduced to an existing context to find they must comply with its norms because of the existence of seemingly natural or inevitable practices woven into the fabric of Work.

\linelabel{demoll49}People who engage in Work are not a homogeneous group and any groups that form are not fixed. The desires, interests, and perceptions of the human are plastic and multi-faceted. External influences are exerted upon \cbstart{}the person\cbend{} such as ethnicity, generational influences, family status, economic well-being, religious and civic institutions, popular culture, mass media and advertising, and political ideology. These serve to shape how power can be exercised both by and upon \cbstart{}the person,\cbend{} such that a group's opinions, desires, and will might appear changeable and indeterminate. This may be illustrated when \cbstart{}a person\cbend{} who displays indifference to or apparently irrational\cbdelete{} changes in its allegiance in response to company attempts at social integration or communications.\linelabel{demoll49a} \citeA{Barenberg1994} suggests \cbstart{}that the person arrives in an unformed state, and that afterwards volatility is retained.\cbend{}

\begin{quotation}
At a general level, empirical study and everyday experience suggest that human beings recognize in their behavior that there are limits to personal and institutional integration in tastes. They know 
that no matter how much they may be pressured both by their own prejudices for integration and by the demands of others, they will be left with contradictory and intermittent desires, partially ordered but imperfectly reconciled\dots{} Human beings are both proponents for preferences and observers of the process by which their preferences are developed and acted upon. As observers of the process by which their beliefs have been formed and consulted, they recognize the good sense in perceptual and moral modesty\dots{} [T]hey appear to be comfortable with an extraordinary array of unreconciled sources of legitimate wants. They maintain a lack of coherence both within and among personal desires, social demands, and moral codes. Though they seek some consistency, they appear to see inconsistency as a normal, and necessary, aspect of the development and 
clarification of tastes. \hfill{}\citeA[pp.~156--157]{March1986}
\end{quotation}

The human finds security and safety in the non-disclosure of their true self, their feelings or intent, that \citeA{Barenberg1994} refers to as `ambiguity' and `inconsistency.' Such behaviours are especially marked in settings of asymmetric power and information where the less powerful deliberately or unconsciously choose ``ambiguous preferences and perceptions as a psychological defense against those with the apparent incentive and communicational resources to manipulate subordinates' preferences and perceptions''~\citeyear[p.~871]{Barenberg1994}. The human has only had recourse to withdraw either themselves or their co-operation from the asymmetric power relationship between themselves and the technological system. \linelabel{demoll58}The technological human on the other hand, does not seek security in non-disclosure, but in the expression of self-worth.  In coming to terms with their place in the `system,' the technological human also brings into phase personal and Work life by creating a technological bridge of information flow. Their role in the enterprise shifts from one of abject subordination to active participation in the decision making processes that provide governance to both themselves and the enterprise.\linelabel{demoll58a}

\section{Theories of participatory democracy} \label{sec:democrat:participation}
\nobreak
\linelabel{demoll62}For a person who has lived all their life under a democratic government, they might assume that democracy and participation go hand in hand and that the use of Web 2.0 technologies, suggest an enhancement in the opportunities for an individual to make decisions on things that will affect them directly. However, it is not necessarily the case that democracy involves participation.\linelabel{demoll62a} In this section I discuss what is meant by participatory democracy and how, for example, it might be usurped.

Discussions by authors on the role of participation in the democratic process or democracy normally focus on the merits of participation versus leadership by an \'{e}lite, and whether or not increased participation weakens or strengthens qualities that denote a system as democratic. In most cases, authors do not address sectors in society other than national and public bodies, and governments, leaving out private institutions since it is assumed that they will be autocratic by nature where democracy has no place. \citeA{Pateman1970} specifically addresses this missing aspect of the discussion and so in this section I will briefly outline Pateman's participatory theory of democracy as it applies in industry. 

Parallels exist between the participatory theory of democracy that \citeA{Pateman1970} describes and the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies in the enterprise. Participatory democracy is referred to particularly on the basis that ``democratic idealists have long envisioned a vital egalitarian society, and for them, the Internet represents a means to implement classical participatory democracy''~\cite[p.~18]{Margolis2009}. 

Contemporary theory of democracy is described as ``a political method or set of institutional arrangements at national level. The characteristically democratic element in the method is the competition of leaders ({\'{e}lites}) for the votes of the people at periodic, free elections\dots{} `participation', so far as the majority is concerned, is participation in the choice of decision makers. Therefore, the function of participation in the theory is solely a protective one; the protection of the individual from arbitrary decisions by elected leaders and the protection of his private interests\dots{} Certain conditions are necessary if the democratic system is to remain stable. The level of participation should not rise much above the minimum necessary to keep the democratic method (electoral machinery) working\dots{} [and] any increase in participation by the apathetic would weaken the consensus of the norms of the democratic method''~\cite[p.~14]{Pateman1970}. 

\citeA{Pateman1970} questions the meaning of the word `participation.' She says it had become a popular term in politics in the later part of the decade of the 1960s. She provides a careful analysis of contemporary and historical political theorists to present a participatory theory of democracy that includes input from Rousseau, J.S.\ and J.\ Mill, and G.D.H.\ Cole. The theory is applied to group phenomena such as Cole's Guild Socialism and to industry because, she says, it represents a small scale political environment in which the principles of participation are observed through experiment. \linelabel{demoll71}In this chapter I am not expressly interested in the inner workings of political systems and their relative merits but that Web 2.0 technologies promote democracy in Work, especially in groups, and that they encourage participation from those who might otherwise not be part of the decision making process. In the industrial or management context, participation provides the opportunity to create conditions in which people are able to influence decisions that affect them. Since influence varies, delegation can be viewed as a special case. A subordinate can gain greater control and freedom of choice relative to their responsibilities.\linelabel{demoll71a} \citeA{McGregor1960} says the term participation ``is usually applied to the subordinate's greater influence within the superior's responsibilities''~\citeyear[p.~124]{McGregor1960}. Participation may be process oriented where, according to \citeA{Sawtell968}, it is those processes non-managerial employees use to reach managerial decisions that affect their work, and \citeA{Lammers1967} says that it is the legitimate upwardly oriented exertion of power by subordinates.
 
Schumpeter's analysis of democracy summarises it as ``~`a political \emph{method}, that is to say, a certain type of institutional arrangement for arriving at political --- legislative and administrative --- decisions'~''~\cite[p.~242]{Schumpeter1943}. \linelabel{demoll74}Under \cbstart{}productionism,\cbend{} the person is absent of decision making power, but participatory disclosure (production) via Web 2.0 technologies provides a means of escape and an emergence into a greater freedom. The technological human recaptures a sense of its social self when it can re-negotiate moral and social boundaries, and regain the power to make decisions about factors that affect it. The process of making decisions is further enhanced when there exists a heterogeneous citizenry in which there exists a range of attitudes, experiences, and abilities.\linelabel{demoll74a} This provides a stable and flexible system in which partisan loyalties remain somewhat fixed, but change occurs when people or policies exert forces that are onerous~\cite{Berelson1954}. However \citeA{Eckstein1966} says that government tends to be more stable when it is congruent with societal patterns of authority and he gives two senses in which that may be observed: a close or graduated resemblance. He promotes the inertial effect of productionist metaphysics  when he says that economic organisations are an example of the type of government that are too removed from democratic principles, and must stay undemocratic, authoritarian, for fear that changes resulting from the democratic decision-making process may lead to ``consequences no one wants''~\citeyear[p.~237]{Eckstein1966}. He says that for a graduated democracy to remain stable, there must also be a healthy element of authoritarianism in its makeup, because effective decision-making can only occur when it is present. The second argument he makes in this regard is that people need firm authoritarian leaders and~leadership.

In \S\ref{text:notion:utopian}, Rousseau's conception of Work was described as being wildly utopian, when he suggests that Work teaches about the wisdom of time and a sense of selfness and reality that protects everybody from imagination, passions, and society's harms. However, \citeA{Pateman1970} takes a different view, describing Rousseau as ``the theorist \emph{par excellence} of participation''~\citeyear[p.~22]{Pateman1970}. She says that his \cbdelete{}political theory hinges on the level of participation that the individual has in the decision-making process, that it is more than just a protection for or from institutional arrangements, and that it ensures a continuing interrelationship between the work of institutions and the psychological qualities and attitudes of the individual who performs Work in them.

Key points from \citeA{Rousseau1968} may be outlined simply.
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item For a participatory system to be successful, certain economic conditions need to be met. That is:
	\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
	\item There needs to be a society in which its members exercise economic equality and independence;
	\item differences in economic equality should not be to the extent that political inequality results; and
	\item each person should own some property because this affords security and independence.
	\end{inparaenum}
\item The members of society need to be interdependent, yet equal and independent.
\item Voting by independent equals provides a situation in which no one need vote for any policy in an assembly where there is no advantage for themselves when compared with the advantages that might be gained by others. Thus, policy that is accepted is done so on the premise that it is acceptable to all and any benefits and burdens are shared by all and therefore is always just.
\item While there would be tacit associations linked by common interests, ideally, there should be no groups present in the decision-making process, just individuals. However, in a situation where it is impossible to prevent such a formation, then there should be as large a number of groups as possible to dissolve their respective influence.
\end{inparaenum}
In summary, participation involves decision-making and is a means of protecting private interests and ensuring good government.

\linelabel{demoll93}The question then arises, how does the technological human exercise effective participation? To which Rousseau \citeyear{Rousseau1968}, Dewey \citeyear{Dewey1927}, and Pateman \citeyear{Pateman1970} answer that it is the system that ought to develop responsible individual, social, and political actions through the process of making effective decisions. Particularly for \citeauthor{Rousseau1968}, the key to the success of this is through education, wherein the individual learns to take into account factors that are greater than themselves and that to gain the co-operation of others; the individual needs to see that their private interests are linked to those of the public.\linelabel{demoll93a}

\citeA{Rousseau1968} says that once the participatory system of democracy has been established, it then becomes self-sustaining, because those attributes and qualities that are required of the individual to ensure the success of the system are the same as those that the process of participation develops. For the educative process of participation to be successful in itself, the individual needs to be able to exert some control over both themselves and others, and for this to be effective, there must therefore be a degree of freedom. ``The individual's actual, as well as his sense of, freedom is increased through participation in decision making because it gives him a very real degree of \emph{control} over the course of his life and the structure of his environnment''~\cite[p.~26]{Pateman1970}. To that extent, the individual might be forced into socially responsible action where they are `forced to be free,' that is they may be obliged to exercise control over those that execute laws and representatives of indirect government. Nevertheless, participation in the process enables the individual's increasing the value of their freedom, because participation enables them to maintain self-mastery, but within the self-imposed constraint of law. By \cbstart{}contrast,\cbend{} \citeA{Dewey1927} relates the existence of the `robber band' with that of the `law abiding citizen.' He says that the `robber band' can only exist in isolation from society because it cannot act flexibly with other groups. Whereas the `law abiding citizen' in a generally law abiding society, finds that if they are part of a political group, then their life will be ``enriching and enriched through their participation in family life, industry, scientific, and artistic associations''~\citeyear[p.~328]{Dewey1927}. Thus, as the individual becomes more involved in participation, they learn to be better participants in the process.

The functions \citeA{Rousseau1968} ascribed to participation previously, that participation forces the individual to deliberate on matters and it forces them toward freedom, then derives a third function as a result of these two. Participation provides a means of social integration, that the individual gains a sense that they belong to something greater than they do. This integration removes considerations of class and social or economic status much like Dewey's \citeyear{Dewey1927} conception of the ``Great Community,'' a theory in which the aim of a democratic government is to pursue the common interest of the public~\cite{MacGilvray2010}. Public(s) consist of all ``those who are affected by the indirect consequences of transactions to such an extent that it is necessary to have those consequences systematically cared for''~\citeyear[p.~245]{Dewey1927}. \citeA{Bohman2010} explains that the members of a public are not the direct participants, those who have full awareness of them\cbdelete{} as engaging in some collective enterprise,\footnote{\citeA{Mead1934} displays a certain optimism at the possibility that the application of democratic norms and ideals in large publics and that those who cross national boundaries will be able to solve problems. Presaging the technological age, he asks whether a conversation might be conducted internationally and that such a question is one of social organisation. Meanwhile \citeauthor{Dewey1927}, saying that the primary purpose of any public is to recognise itself as a public, having one that is international in makeup presents obstacles and barriers to that possibility from actuating. ``The [technological] age has so enormously expanded, multiplied, intensified, and complicated the scope of indirect consequences, formed such immense and consolidated unions in action, on an impersonal rather than a community basis, that the resulting public cannot identify and distinguish itself''~ \cite[p.~314]{Dewey1927}. Web 2.0 facilitates the formation of publics, and these may exist on an international scale. Dewey's hesitation appears \cbstart{}to be\cbend{} focussed on the inability of those who populate a public to scale social and cultural boundaries and history has shown that this is not the case.} but those who are affected indirectly by the consequences of the actions of social and political arrangements. That is to say, the members of the public have no authority or power within their domain. Whenever the individual works on behalf of the public, they become a part of the Great Community. The individual is made to feel that ``not only [is] the common weal \dots his weal, but that it partly depends on his exertions''~\cite[p.~230]{Mill1963}. 

Dewey's view is largely congruent with Rousseau's political theory of democracy but unlike the utopian Rousseau, \citeauthor{Dewey1927} accepts that such a democratic form will most likely never eventuate, although through experimentation, apparent conflicts between disparate Publics in a political community can be resolved or mitigated. \citeauthor{Dewey1927}  suggests that improvements in society come about when the role of the government is to provide the means of communication between conflicting groups rather than trying to mediate between them. \citeauthor{Rousseau1968} would agree, adding that the major function of participation is that it is educative.

\citeA{Mill1965} describes how the individual has the opportunity to gain experience in the management of collective affairs in the same way it is exercised in local government. Real value is to be found in socialism and co-operation and especially as a means of education. Voluntary organisations in small communities that replicate national applications of principles accommodate widespread and disparate participation. The benefits, when extended to a co-operative industrial organisation are outlined. 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item Provide conditions for a `moral transformation' of those who take part, leading to an increase in production.
\item Instigate a friendly rivalry in the pursuit of a common good.
\item Elevate the dignity of labour.
\item Provide for a renewed sense of security and independence in the labouring class.
\item Transform of the person's occupation from being merely a job to an opportunity to learn about socialisation and matters of practical intelligence.
\end{inparaenum}
To an extent, \citeauthor{Mill1965} considers that the industrial organisation can play a role similar to that of the government in teaching the individual about social responsibility. Principally, in Mill's view of the modern world, the fundamental relationship between the employer and employee has changed so that what existed previously would no longer be maintainable. For this to be possible, ``the authority relationship would have to be transformed from the usual one of superiority-subordination (managers and men) to one of co-operation or equality with the managers (government) being elected by the whole body of employees just as representatives at the local level are elected''~\cite[p.~34--35]{Pateman1970}. 

\linelabel{demoll112}\textls[8]{The utopian perspective presented here, fundamentally changes the function of Work. The labourer's attitude to their Work shifts from that provided by productionist metaphysics and, as a democratic process, becomes educative and enriching for the individual and the industrial organisation on the one hand, and it gives the labourer greater control over both those factors that they can influence, and that influence them, on the other.\linelabel{demoll112a} \citeA{Bohman2010} adds that Mill argued for citizens' to be given the opportunity to deliberate on matters that affect them, and by doing so they build knowledge of their current situation (epist\'e{}m\'e{}) and commonalities between them. The discourse that results does not require that they should renounce concrete identities and opinions.}

\newpage{}In her discussion of G.D.H. Cole and in particular his theory of Guild Socialism, \citeA{Pateman1970} says that Cole's social and political theory builds on Rousseau's argument that it is will and not force that forms the basis of organisations. That means people must co-operate if their needs are to be satisfied and for actions to be just, that is to not infringe upon the freedom of others, and people need to participate in the organising and regulation of their associations. His is a theory, \citeauthor{Pateman1970} says, of associations such that society is composed of them and the individual must be prepared to participate in all those in which they are involved.

Cole's purpose for associations is through the principle that democracy is itself manifest only through its function and purpose. It is through the assignment of functions throughout society that the individual finds understanding of the whole system, a state which cannot be achieved if the individual can only take recourse via a representative or mediator. Thus, Cole makes the distinction between national `institutional arrangements' and democracy. \citeA{Pateman1970} makes the point that the individual needs to be able to participate in all those associations that concern them, and for this to take effect, democracy must be participatory. However, Cole also says that it is in industry that the average person spends the greatest amount of their time and effort and in this arena; they are taught to be subservient to their superiors through their daily occupation. The circumstances of their lives lead them to be unfit for power or responsibility. \cbstart{}This is reflected in a politically servile population.\cbend{} \linelabel{demoll117}Thus, productionist metaphysics provides for the technological human, the training for it to be dependent upon the `system.'

By what means can the technological human who has been taught to be subservient, \cbdelete{}then turn around and be self-governing? Cole's reply is that if industry were organised on a participatory basis, then the effort expended on teaching staff to be servile could be equally spent on training them for democracy~\cite{Pateman1970}.\linelabel{demoll120} Cole's principal objection to the capitalist organisation of industry is that it represents the productionist metaphysical notion, that labour is no more than a commodity and the individual is denied their humanity. The Guild Socialist system is supposed to provide \cbstart{}for not only \cbend{}humanity to remain intact, but \cbstart{}also\cbend{} that it offers the individual the right of equality and opportunity too. Under his participatory system, first the structure would be flat with all having equal rights of decision-making. Leadership would be provided \cbstart{}based on\cbend{} its representative function. Material efficiency, as a prime goal of industry, entails a central focus under Taylor. However, in Cole's Guild Socialism, rather than the motive of profit being the driver, it is instead the motive of free service offered when workers see how their efforts benefit the community~\cite{Pateman1970}. Cole goes much further, describing functions throughout society, leading to a national congress. However, as has already been stated, industry is the manifestation of productionist metaphysics and is largely authoritarian. It is utopian to suppose that industry leaders will simply give up power and control in their organisation. It is also wise to remember that most industrial organisations that exist in society are `owned' and their `owners' have a \cbstart{}stake\cbend{} in the running of them and the retention of their claims to ownership.

Principally, \citeauthor{Pateman1970} makes the argument that
\begin{quotation*}
\dots{}the central assertion [is] that individuals and their institutions cannot be considered in isolation from one another\dots{} The major function of participation in the theory of participatory democracy is [that it is] educative in the very widest sense, including both the psychological aspect and the gaining of practice in democratic skills and procedures. \dots{} there is no special problem about the stability of a participatory system; it is self-sustaining through the educative impact of the participatory process. Participation develops and fosters the very qualities necessary for it; the more individuals participate the better able they [are to do it]. \emph{Subsidiary hypotheses} about participation are that it has an integrative effect and that it aids the acceptance of collective decisions. \hfill{}\citeA[p.~42--43]{Pateman1970}
\end{quotation*}
\indent{}Therefore, for a democratic polity to exist it is also necessary for all political systems to be democratised and, \citeA{Pateman1970} says, industry is the most important area of a participatory democracy since that is where people spend most of their time and the opportunity to provide education is unparalleled. \citeauthor{Pateman1970} identifies three senses or forms of participation from empirical evidence she has investigated:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item \emph{Participation as control} --- the impact of different Work situations affects the psychological orientation expressed by individuals, and is a crucial variable in how much control they are able to exercise over their own job and their job environment.
\item \emph{Participation as satisfaction} --- worker's satisfaction with their job is found to correlate to levels of morale, efficiency, and productivity; and 
\item \emph{Increases in participation} --- for example, job enlargement programmes are designed to broaden the boundaries of the individual's job and increases in decision-making opportunities to give them more autonomy over factors that affect their conditions and productivity.
\end{inparaenum}

\section[Information systems, asymmetric power distribution, \\ and participation]{Information systems, asymmetric power \\ distribution, and participation} \label{sec:democrat:IS}
\nobreak
The essence of the technological system is brought into question when consideration is given to the relationship between human strengths and weaknesses illustrated by democracy and asymmetric power distribution. \citeA{Heidegger1954} identifies modern technology as a means to an end, that everything depends on society having a hand in manipulating technology so that the ends it serves are those of the human who must master it. \linelabel{demoll137}However, the essence of the technological system lies elsewhere: the definition of technology purely as an instrument or artefact does not reveal its essence, \cbstart{}instead\cbend{} the definition describes the functions to which technology is applied.\linelabel{demoll137a}

\newpage{}\linelabel{demoll140}Attempts at describing or defining technologies are generally left to technologists where questions regarding technology are posed within a purely technical framework. Technical problems are generally framed so that solutions will be technical in nature.\linelabel{demoll140a} In this way, \citeA{Laudon1991} define information systems as sets of procedures that collect or retrieve data, processes and stores them, and then disseminates information to support decision making and control. \linelabel{demoll140b}However, a definition by technologists does not acknowledge that the system exists as a human manufacture, but that the system is the means and end in itself. The information system they define finds its being in the technological system.\linelabel{demoll140c} \linelabel{demoll140d}Any definitions that do attempt to extend into human terms make reference to terminology generally accepted in the field of \IS{}, for example, that benefits have accrued in the transition from `manual' methods of information processing to `automated' or computerised information systems.\linelabel{demoll140e} The range of benefits \cbstart{}is\cbend{} specific to the context in which they are designed and implemented.\cbdelete{} 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item \cbstart{}To improve efficiencies in the organisation, redesign business processes.\cbend{}
\item \cbstart{}Providing relevant information facilitates business planning processes, thus improving decision making\cbend{} (although the volumes of information produced and the complex nature of businesses also means that middle-managers and executives find it increasingly difficult to monitor operations).
\item \cbstart{}Data may be summarised in regular reports and real-time outputs. If these are displayed on dashboards, they may address issues of information overload.\cbend{}
\item The production of reports and real-time views \cbdelete{}allow \cbdelete{}operational decision-making to be delegated down with confidence, leaving more scope for strategic decisions and decentralisation of large enterprises.
\item The decentralisation and delegation of operational decision-making processes \cbdelete{}allow \cbdelete{}improved co-ordination and integration of specialised roles and activities across departmental boundaries.
\item \cbstart{}To evaluate performance and thus to make more effective decisions, various tools and models for management are provided.\cbend{}
\item Improvement in operational processes and decision-making at all levels should lead to reduced costs.
\item \cbstart{}In specific operational areas, there may be higher levels of predictability.\cbend{} 
\item Improvement in the enterprise's competitive position through cost reductions, improved processes, better levels of reactivity and customer responsiveness, and better decision making processes.
\end{inparaenum}

\cbstart{}However,\cbend{} listing\cbdelete{} expected benefits to the enterprise from the deployment of an information system does not address the ends to which the instrumental technological system is affected. \citeA{Heidegger1954} says the means is that which results from when something is effected, and that the means by which something else is effected is a cause. The cause may also be derived from the end that determines the means and the ends pursued and means employed are led by causality when, as in the example of the information system, instrumentality is a core feature. 

In referring to four causes,\footnote{Aristotle described four causes: ``
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item The \emph{causa materialis,} the material, the matter out of which, for example, a silver chalice is made;
\item the \emph{causa formalis,} the form, the shape into which the material enters;
\item the \emph{causa finalis,} the end, for example, the sacrificial rite in relation to which the required chalice is determined as to its form and matter;
\item the \emph{causa efficiens,} in this instance, the silversmith''
\end{inparaenum}~\citeyear[pp.~313--314]{Heidegger1954}. These are described in more detail on page~\pageref{text:evolution:causes}.} \citeA{Heidegger1954} addresses the presumption that objects are subject to presencing and that they are, in a sense, lying about waiting for the \emph{causa efficiens} to offer disclosure and that technology, as a means, \cbstart{}it is disclosed\cbend{} when its instrumentality is traced back to this fourfold causality. \linelabel{demoll161}For the field of \IS{} today, the information system exists as the \emph{causa formalis}, an artefact\label{text:democrat:artefact} that is definable in the sense that it is a technological object.\footnote{The \IT{} artefact was defined as ``those bundles of material and cultural properties packaged in some socially-recognizable form such as hardware and/or software''~\cite[p.~122]{Orlikowski2001}.} The technological artefact is itself a mode of revealing where \emph{al\={e}theia} represents the truth of where and how disclosiveness happens, but this does not fit with what the technological system produces. This conception is true of the \emph{causa efficiens} but does not adequately encompass objects produced by the technological system. Early information systems were designed to replicate work practices found in enterprises at the time and this has decided the \emph{causa formalis} and the manner in which \emph{causa finalis} is exercised by those who are tasked to perform the rituals of information processing. The \emph{causa efficiens}, the builder of the technological system, is the whole support structure from designer to maintainer, it is the systems analysts and designers who fill the middle ground between the `user community' and the `programming community'~\cite{GaneSarson1979}.\linelabel{demoll161a} Within this, where  is the Work? What form does that take?

The work to which the technological system is applied is a revealing, but not in the sense of bringing-forth as in \emph{poi\={e}sis}. Rather, it takes the form of a challenging\footnote{\citeA[p.~320]{Heidegger1954} uses the phrase \emph{Herausfordern}.} in which nature is challenged to provide data that are stored, are set-in-order, and \emph{set upon} nature itself. This \emph{setting upon} expedites, in the sense of unlocking and exposure, the technological system's drive towards some other goal such as those benefits that might be accorded a business. Challenging occurs through the revealing of what is locked up when released from its natural state, transformed, stored, distributed, and switched about in turn. The revealing never \cbstart{}ends,\cbend{} it reveals to itself increasing numbers and iterations of interlocking paths, a web. The revealing is \cbstart{}determined, it is regulated and at every intersection, it is secured.\cbend{}

\linelabel{demoll166}Data called upon for ordering exists as a standing reserve,\label{text:democrat:stdgres} but they are more than mere stock in hand for purveyors of such things.\linelabel{demoll166a} The standing reserve ``designates nothing less than the way in which everything presences that is wrought upon by the revealing that challenges''~\cite[p.~323]{Heidegger1954}, \linelabel{demoll166b}despite the conception of the information system as a means to automation of existing processes and the separation of processes physically, emotionally, and psychologically from the systems operator.\linelabel{demoll166c} \linelabel{demoll166d}Yet the information system is not yet autonomous in the Hegelian sense and the question is raised: \cbstart{}what\cbend{} accomplishes the challenging \cbdelete{}to produce the standing reserve?\linelabel{demoll166e} \linelabel{demoll166f}While \cbdelete{}the technological human\cbdelete{} is capable of conceiving, fashioning, and carrying forward the intentionality of the execution of the \IT{} artefact, the \cbstart{}technological human\cbend{} does not have control over the disclosure of data. The technological human can only respond to what is addressed to it because it abdicated responsibility to itself and pre-industrial societal values and norms in favour of becoming `independent' of nature, thus subservient to the technological system.\linelabel{demoll166g}

\linelabel{demoll169}The\cbdelete{} technological human appears to be of the standing reserve, no less than any other resource (which is seen in the habit of referring to `human resources' and the management of `customer resources'). The subservient worker who operates at the information system interface is subordinate to the data they appear to control and this extends throughout the enterprise where they are challenged by the information requirements of managers and executives. Upper levels of the hierarchy are in turn challenged by their customers, competitors, suppliers, and the world at large. While that may appear to be the case, it is technological human `who' that transcends the standing reserve through its power of ordering and takes part in the ordering that is passed down to the technological system. \linelabel{demoll169a}

\ColourTextRed{\section{Participative democracy and Web 2.0} \label{sec:democrat:web20}
\nobreak
\citeA{Pateman1970} refers to power distribution and participation within the context of the democratic process. In this, she says that democracy is effectively a means for the selection and establishment of \'{e}lites. The chosen \'{e}lite is granted the power to make decisions on behalf of the mass, thus the system requires that an asymmetric distribution of power exists. However, the strength of the democratic system is that the mass has the option to change their decision makers on a regular basis. This is contrasted with the enterprise where the approach is autocratic and power asymmetries are maintained to ensure that decisions are carried out as required.}

\ColourTextRed{In very large organisations, an autocratic style of management has been shown to be rigid and inflexible. As limiters to responsiveness, this may become an impediment to change and growth and provides justification for the assertion that the enterprise leads to entropy.\footnote{See \pageref{notion141b}:\ref{notion141b}.} Advances in communications technologies, such as Web 2.0, have given those enterprises who have been able to take advantage of them, significant competitive advantage. IBM saw staff that held significant knowledge and experience were also those who held management positions \cite{MajchrzakCherbakovIves2009}. Their position within the organisational hierarchy often put them out of reach with new members of staff. IBM recognised that new entrants to the enterprise often had innovative ideas but lacked the means to implement them. The solution trialled involved the deployment of social networking applications that included visualisation tools to map power relationships and networks. The positive effect was that new staff members were able to build mentoring relationships with senior staff; innovative product development commenced when it may not have otherwise, and decision making power on project acceptance shifted down in the chain of command.}

\ColourTextRed{In the technological system, mistrust and the threat of attack mark the enterprise. These fears are reflected upon the workers, who are regarded as untrustworthy and must be controlled. These are the authoritarian means required to maintain power. \citeA{KimYuePerkinsHallGates2009} report that the facilities that Web 2.0 offer, for example, keeping in touch with friends and family and so on, also allow individuals to influence policies and standards. While for some enterprises, this poses too much of a risk, for others like BT, policies already exist and the risk is manageable \cite{Dennison2007}. Initial misgivings were shown to be unwarranted and staff took to the tools, using them to facilitate information dissemination, decision making processes, group facilitation, and social functions. Workers' ability to act responsibly within the democratic functions in the social networking applications were confirmed and staff who contributed positively were recognised across the enterprise.}

\ColourTextRed{\textls[12]{For established and entropic organisations, processes may be the result of years of accumulated adaptation. Such processes are not necessarily efficient, nor do they always deliver what is required. In the FCC case, the distributed nature of the enterprise and other factors meant that certain core processes (particularly loan renewals) were not being carried out efficiently, accurately, or consistently. The account provided by \citeA{SmithMcKeen2008} outlines these issues and presents a thorough analysis of the deployment of a \soa{}. Principal outcomes are that technical and managerial staff are now able to work better as a team, field staff make more consistent decisions, training new staff is eased through the deployment of contextualised and consistent materials, and policies are understood and can be authenticated. Whilst not in the social networking space, infrastructure does form an important part of Web 2.0 \cite{Oreilly2005}.}}

\ColourTextRed{Opaque decision making processes distinguishes autocracy from other democratic forms of leadership. That is, there is no transparency in decision making and those who are affected by decisions may not have any influence in the process or outcome. Those who are involved in the production of journals and other peer reviewed media will understand the need for the double blind process, however \citeA{KaneFichman2009} question whether reviewers and others who are involved in the editorial process should be included. They propose a wiki-based solution to facilitate participatory decision making through deliberation. In their view, the decisions for inclusion or exclusion, and suggestions for improvement, ought to be made collaboratively by the editorial team. }

\ColourTextRed{In each of these cases, Web 2.0 applications provide the means for the redistribution of power through deliberation, participation, and education. This provides the mechanism for a person to participate in making a decision. In the Heideggarian sense, the person can regain the Dasein that was lost to productionism. Thus, the person regains control over their job, to obtain satisfaction, and choose to live in accordance with a moral and ethical code. Web 2.0 encourages that person who had previously chosen to be ambiguous or non-responsive, to become actively engaged.}

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:democrat:conclusion}
\nobreak
The technological system is more than just a human activity; \cbstart{}in the revelation of matter, the matter is ordered.\cbend{} The human is challenged to order the actual, as data, as a standing reserve in accordance with how the system is revealed. The challenge gathers the human into ordering, and that concentrates it upon ordering the actual, again as data, as standing reserve. It is through inculcation of the human into the technological system that \citeA{Heidegger1954} refers to as \emph{Gestell} or `enframing' and is the term applied to the essence of the technological system.

\linelabel{demoll192b}To frame means the gathering together of the setting-upon that sets upon the human, that is it challenges the human to come forth, to reveal the actual, in the mode of ordering, as standing reserve.\linelabel{demoll192c} It is the way that revealing governs in the technological system but is not itself anything technological. \linelabel{demoll192}\cbstart{}Not all parts that are to do with the assemblage of the technological system are\cbend{} of the enframing but merely respond to the challenge of it. The technological parts, while responding, never comprise a part of~the~enframing. \linelabel{demoll192a}

\linelabel{demoll196}\label{text:Workastheengagement}Work, as the engagement of the human in coming forth and ordering the actual in concert with the technological system, sees the human processing the essence of the system as enframing. The technological human's engagement with the essence of the technological system conjoins their purpose and becomes one of participation in which the technological system operates as proxy to human intent. The human participant, who can only respond to what is addressed (carried forward through the concept of the Idea), requires that the technological system perform the role of ordering the standing reserve and framing the actual.\linelabel{demoll196a}

\linelabel{demoll198}The technological human, under productionist metaphysics, is destined by what must be done, behave, respond to, or not and these separate the technological human from its essence. \cbstart{}Nevertheless,\cbend{} the human form retains the capacity to \cbstart{}respond creatively and with originality.\cbend{} Thus, the essence of the human is not tied to that of the technological human \cbstart{}albeit that it is\cbend{} framed by the technological system,\cbdelete{} \cbstart{}which\cbend{} challenges and orders the actual, \cbstart{}and\cbend{} challenges \cbdelete{}the technological human through ordering.\cbdelete{} However, the system is an artefact\label{text:democrat:artefact1} that \cbstart{}was\cbend{} brought forth and disclosed by the human. \cbdelete{}This is the appearance that the technological human is destined to be, both \cbstart{}as standing reserve and in abdication of its freedom to decide and choose.\cbend{} Thus, the technological human displays ambivalence towards \cbdelete{}Work.\linelabel{demoll198a}

\linelabel{demoll202}\cbstart{}Democratisation of work practices may lead to greater decision-making power and adaptation of systems to suit individual requirements. Where once information systems stood apart from the operator, as machines in the workplace, and where the operator was regarded only as the end-user of the system, they are now more properly regarded as participants in the system.\cbend{}

The technological human as participant, is not just the operator or end-user of an information system, \cbdelete{}they engage \emph{with} information systems to perform the work that is required of them. At the time that \citeA{Heidegger1954} wrote, modern technology took the form of televised broadcasts, nuclear power, and large hydro-electric power stations extracting electric power from the Rhine to fuel monstrous foundries and factories. Modern technology in the mid-twentieth century was writ in the large and the massive. In the twenty-first century, it takes the form of the personal, the small, the ubiquitous, the connected, and combined and they dwarf the large-scale schemes of the '50s. This is the\cbdelete{} juggernaut where the form of modern technology in the twenty-first century involves the technological human, but not as the mere operator of a machine. The technological human has become participant in the technological system. It is joined with the essence of technology and\cbdelete{} enframes itself within the future that technology forecasts. The future of the technological human is intertwined with the future of technology and in it servitude to the Will to Will of the system. The technological human \cbstart{}has abdicated\cbend{} responsibility to self and in this state. \cbstart{}However, \cbend{}where does the person who engages with modern technology find their sense of freedom to be true to their human nature?\linelabel{demoll202a}

\linelabel{demoll206}It is participation in the democratic sense that Work becomes educative and enriching with the participant's acceptance of greater responsibility and control over localised \cbstart{}affairs.\cbend{} Web 2.0 technologies promote democracy in Work and encourage participation from those who might otherwise not be part of the decision making process. \cbstart{}To take advantage, hierarchical\cbend{} managerial structures need to adopt a new Idea and form, so that decision making is conducted at operational levels and asymmetries of power are reframed. Freedom is gained by workers when they learn to take into account factors that are greater than \cbstart{}they are.\cbend{} They learn, for example, to seek co-operation of their peers' individual needs so that their private interests are synchronised with those of the enterprise and this builds a history of success so they learn to be better participants in the process.\linelabel{demoll206a}

\linelabel{demoll209}In the enterprise, \cbstart{}where improved means of communication are provided, then improvements in participation may be recognised and encouraged.\cbend{} Disputes and conflicts between opposing views \cbstart{}may be\cbend{} resolved through the inter-mediation of negotiation between groups and individuals rather than the enterprise stepping in to mediate. \linelabel{demoll209a}

\linelabel{demoll212}A form of participative democracy, deliberative democracy, provides \cbstart{}opportunities\cbend{} for holders of opposing views to build knowledge of the \cbstart{}disputed\cbend{} situation and find commonalities. These processes do not mean that the groups or individuals are required to relinquish their identity, but allows them opportunities to improve their stance and create new frames within the technological system. As they reframe their reality, technological humanity reorders itself.\cbdelete{} \linelabel{demoll212a} Integrating with the essence of the technological system allows the person to obtain of its power of ordering and partake of its capacity to offer democratically deliberative processes through the medium of Web 2.0. \cbstart{}In this way, the technological human as the standing reserve, is subject to both itself and the technological system.\cbend{}

In chapter \ref{chap:socialisation}, the concept of enframing is applied to an objective conception of Work to illustrate how the technological system affects the social nature of the human, and how the human responds to that in turn. The human tendency to bring into its environment unanticipated variations and approaches becomes a point of weakness in the technological system, but the capacity for Web 2.0 to introduce participatory democracy to the workplace, enables the technological human to re-engage its social dimension and partake of argumentation to reach agreement. The technological system is strengthened through such processes, but not at the cost to the participant, rather the strengthening is mutually advantageous to both the enterprise and the worker.
