\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
\nobreak{}
Chapter \ref{chap:litrev} presents a review of literature in which the Work System conception is described, discussed, how it has changed, leading to the research question for this thesis. In \S\Ref{sec:WorkSystemConcept} the concept of the Work System is defined and its origination in the field of Scientific Management. In this section, the history of change over time is outlined as understandings of the workplace evolved to become more socially acceptable, for example through the adoption of sociotechnical theory. 

In \S\ref{sec:AltersWorkSystem}, Alter's use of the term, Work System is presented. He defined the Work System as an \IS{} theory and described it as a means of analysing an enterprise's current system to identify areas of possible improvement. Alter has made more use of the term than any other \IS{} researcher and has done the most to define the Work System in \IS{}. In \S\ref{sec:WSInISDevelopment}, an ontological conception of the Work System is presented. This section demonstrates that the way in which the actual world is classified determines what kind of information system might be developed. In \S\ref{sec:ImpactOfTech} the effects of new technologies, and in this instance Web 2.0, are described such that Work becomes increasingly participatory and provides an environment in which the human can regain a sense of its lost social self. Finally, in \S\ref{sec:Explication}, the arguments that are presented in this chapter are brought together as a conclusion leading to the research question.

\ColourTextRed{\textls[12]{In chapter \ref{chap:intro}, the argument that Work exists in both material and immaterial manifestations was made. Such an approach provides opportunity for Work to be regarded both physically and as an abstraction. In chapter \ref{chap:litrev}, this approach is extended, through an analysis of literature, to present instances of where and how the conceptions of Work and the Work System have been addressed. I present the argument that \label{text:litrev.ll63}there exists a presumption in \is{}, that the meaning of `Work System' is \emph{a priori}: that there exists an assumption that the meaning is adequately transposed from its originating usage in the industrial setting.\footnote{\pageref{ll63}:\ref{ll63}--\pageref{ll63a}:\ref{ll63a}. } However, modern information systems are held to be abstractions of the material worlds that blur the lines between the social, moral, ethical, psychic, and motive. The perception is strengthened by contrasting the Taylorist conception that is built upon a physical reality that is rational and predictable, and the reality of modern computing (in this instance, Web 2.0) that is based upon abstractions of the physical}.\footnote{See commentary on the approach: \pageref{ll116}:\ref{ll116}--\pageref{ll116a}:\ref{ll116a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{Thus, an argument that an objective understanding of reality requires that the material worlds be viewed as an abstraction is made.\footnote{\pageref{ll248}:\ref{ll248}--\pageref{ll248a}:\ref{ll248a}.} For example, in \S\ref{sec:WSInISDevelopment}, the Work System, as an ontological conception, is regarded as an abstraction of a physical reality. Such an abstraction permits the identification of features as constants, and the removal of instantiations that might otherwise obfuscate understanding. A researcher, who works with an abstraction of the physical worlds, may then apply the constants to make sense of phenomena.\footnote{\pageref{ll248b}:\ref{ll248b}--\pageref{ll248c}:\ref{ll248c}.} In this case, instantiations from the material world are selectively applied to abstractions to see (in the Peircean sense) what, if any, the effect that practical application of theory will have.}

\ColourTextRed{The \IT{} artefact, Web 2.0, presents a unique opportunity to observe the effects of change, both socially and technologically. As an artefact, Web 2.0 comprises extant technologies that have been reapplied for various purposes, but as a social phenomenon, I assert that Web 2.0 provides the means for social and cultural alteration and change. I further argue that changes may be effected through political, social, economic, and technological means.\footnote{\pageref{ll289}:\ref{ll289}--\pageref{ll289a}:\ref{ll289a}. \pageref{ll294}:\ref{ll294}--\pageref{ll294a}:\ref{ll294a}. \pageref{ll302}:\ref{ll302}--\pageref{ll302a}:\ref{ll302a}. \pageref{ll309}:\ref{ll309}--\pageref{ll309a}:\ref{ll309a}. } }

\ColourTextRed{When change is perceived, it is situated according to context. For example, there exist subtly differing conceptions of ontology, depending upon whether the context of use is in computer science or philosophy. In this thesis, both conceptions are used, but within each context.\footnote{\pageref{ll256}:\ref{ll256}--\pageref{ll256a}:\ref{ll256a}.} In \S\ref{sec:WSInISDevelopment:ontCons}, the context is philosophical and related to building theory, rather than taxonomy. To build an ontological perspective requires the identification and description of the relationships between elements. Since elements must be considered non-static, their relationships are too.\footnote{\pageref{ll256b}:\ref{ll256b}--\pageref{ll256c}:\ref{ll256c}. \pageref{ll349}:\ref{ll349}--\pageref{ll349a}:\ref{ll349a}. } In \S\ref{sec:WSInISDevelopment:methCons}, two authors with differing views on the Work System are pitched against each other to highlight the issue of change in development environments.\footnote{\pageref{ll272}:\ref{ll272}--\pageref{ll284}:\ref{ll284}. } }

\ColourTextRed{A further argument presented in chapter \ref{chap:litrev} posits that Taylorism is representative of the worst kind of application of science. The scientific method has been used as a justification for the most heinous of social crimes, where `progress' is the catch phrase that masks true intent.\footnote{\pageref{ll325}:\ref{ll325}--\pageref{ll325a}:\ref{ll325a}.} Appropriation of science has allowed for a reconceptualisation or reframing of what it means to be natural and human. The positivistic scientific method provides justification for holding humanity as an advanced animal to be tamed and controlled, rather than as an entity that comprises those properties outlined in \S\ref{sec:intro.human}, and in particular the metaphysical.\footnote{\pageref{ll338}:\ref{ll338}--\pageref{ll338a}:\ref{ll338a}. }}

\ColourTextRed{It is argued that attempts at rationalisation of natural phenomena has resulted in anything construed as being natural is therefore branded as irrational. Thus, human qualities such as socialisation through family affiliations, attachment to people or places, creative expression such as the work of the artisan or the artist, are irrational and therefore of no account and uneconomic. When such phenomena obstruct the progression of rational production, then they must either be eliminated or reframed and made useful. The highest form of rationalisation is systematic progress. The classification of systems that use technology to enable production are referred to in the singular, as the technological system. }

\ColourTextRed{However, those who would wield power and dominion over others in rational production are no less consumed by the same system as that used in their domination over others. This creates the conditions for the barber's paradox.\footnote{\pageref{ll329}:\ref{ll329}--\pageref{ll329a}:\ref{ll329a}.} I argue that the current attitude maintains that the only solution to the barber's paradox is for the technological system to be the perpetrator, where all of humanity is the victim.\footnote{\pageref{ll329b}:\ref{ll329b}--\pageref{ll329c}:\ref{ll329c}. \pageref{ll334}:\ref{ll334}--\pageref{ll334a}:\ref{ll334a}. }\footnote{This is Heidegger's position and one that I shall argue against.} However, my argument proceeds: that humanity maintains the attribute of creativity\footnote{\pageref{ll344}:\ref{ll344}--\pageref{ll344a}:\ref{ll344a}. } and it is printed on the human and cannot be eliminated, despite efforts to the contrary. Creativity is expressed both as the urge to reproduce, and as the need for expression. Attempts suppress the creativity that exists in the person may be successful for a time, but eventually those urges break free violently.\footnote{\pageref{socll62}:\ref{socll62}--\pageref{socll62a}:\ref{socll62a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{The barber's paradox can be seen in the juggernaut\footnote{\pageref{ll366}:\ref{ll366}--\pageref{ll366a}:\ref{ll366a}.} and becomes a core theme in the thesis. In the popular Western understanding of the word, the juggernaut conjures a vision of an out of control behemoth, bent on destruction. The sense here is one of control over the mass of humanity, where all are assimilated into the body of the whole and where individual identities are lost.\footnote{\pageref{ll362}:\ref{ll362}--\pageref{ll362a}:\ref{ll362a}. } The juggernaut becomes the vehicle, as the material form of the cybernetic world\footnote{\pageref{ll370}:\ref{ll370}--\pageref{ll370a}:\ref{ll370a}. } and humanity is compelled to submit to the juggernaut to satisfy humanity's need for security. However, while the price of admittance to security is humanity's sense of self (Dasein), I argue that the essence of humanity remains, untouched.\footnote{\pageref{ll387}:\ref{ll387}--\pageref{ll387a}:\ref{ll387a}. }}

\section{The Work System Concept} \label{sec:WorkSystemConcept}
\nobreak
In \S\ref{sec:WorkSystemConcept}, over time the parts, purposes, and organisation of the Work System have changed. The reason why changes are made vary and range from the impact of practical exigencies that manifest in the working environment \cite<for example,>{Trist2000} to the \cbstart{}effect\cbend{} that new understandings of social organisation have on the workplace \cbstart{}\cite<for example,>{Mumford1983}.\cbend{}

The term, Work System, stems from Scientific Management that featured in the rapid industrialisation of North America at the end of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, where it applies to piece-work performed by semi- or unskilled workers~\cite{Taylor1911}. In the Work System conception, Work exists for the purposes of generating goods and services for sale or distribution to customers. The aim is to improve the efficiency and productivity of work and encourages the scientific selection, training, and development of workers and the equal division of work between workers and management \cite{Wertheim2007}. \cbdelete{}

\label{text:litrev.rasmussen}\citeA{Rasmussen1992} says Work within the Work System depends on the purposeful transformation of items found in the working environment, where the transformation may or may not be made directly by the workers themselves. The act of Work performed \newpage{}\noindent{}by workers creates \cbdelete{}boundary conditions, inside of which active forces bring about intended and purposeful \cbstart{}change.\cbend{} 

\citeA{Trist2000} redefine aspects of the Work System so\cbdelete{} it relates more closely to the Longwall Method.\cbdelete{} In a study of the coal industry they make the observation that despite workers utilising improved technology, and receiving better pay and conditions, productivity fell, while absenteeism increased. In their study, the cause was determined to be the adoption of a new form of production technology creating the need for an excessively bureaucratic form of organisation, which in turn, introduced a retrograde step in how the workers perceived their part in the process of task completion. The excessive requirement to document task steps\cbdelete{} and seek management approval for activities that were previously undertaken with a degree of autonomy, were seen as an imposition by sufficient numbers of workers, causing productivity to fall. In the proposed solution, the Work System becomes part of the socio-technical system (which  comes out from sociotechnical \cbstart{}theory\footnote{See footnote \ref{text:cherns}, on page \pageref{text:cherns}.}\cbend{}). 

In their proposed solution, \citeA{Trist2000} assert that it is the purposeful transformation of items within the Work System that becomes the task assigned, so a whole task encompasses those attributes that define a task's activities, outcomes, participants, inputs, work allocations, timing, and effort. \citeauthor{Trist2000} say that assigning a whole task to a group of workers means the group accepts responsibility for the task's success and the group's members experience all aspects of the task's operations.\footnote{ The assignation of a task to a group of workers in the manner described introduces the notion of `minimal critical specification:' that it is important the group knows \emph{what} is to be done, but rarely is it important to define \emph{how} it is to be done.} The key factor is the group's acceptance of autonomy and to make decisions, based on local conditions, about how best to undertake their assigned task in a flexible and adaptive manner. As the group is assigned new tasks, the members gain experience \newpage{}\noindent{}and can apply what they have learned to new situations. Thus, the group's management can be less prescriptive about tasks \cite{Rice1958}. 

The variations to the Work System conception described by \citeauthor{Trist2000} introduce social and human factors into the design of tasks.\footnote{\label{text:cherns}For example \citeA{Cherns1987} lists principles that guide sociotechnical theory. These include: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item That the design process must be compatible with its objectives;
\item that no more about a task should be specified than is absolutely essential and that what needs to be done in the task is stated but \cbstart{}not\cbend{} how to do it;
\item organisation and function boundaries should be drawn with care to allow the sharing of information, knowledge and learning;
\item information needed to take action should be provided when and where it is required;
\item groups should exercise the degree of power and authority needed in order to accept responsibility for their performance
\item it is beneficial for an organisation to have employees with knowledge of a wide range of tasks;
\item systems of social support should reinforce required behaviour and be consistent with the work design philosophy;
\item planning and design are required for the transition from a traditional to a new organisation; and
\item systems design is an interactive and continuous process.
\end{inparaenum}}
 This marks a significant shift in how Work in an industrial environment may be successfully undertaken. \citeA{WilsonWhittington2001} take this further by saying that the objective of organisational design should be to provide a good quality of work life for team members alongside achieving performance outcomes. Ways this can be achieved are for jobs to be varied and demanding, have the element of `on the job' learning, provide for decision making, offer social support and recognition, relate to work and social lives, and give the feeling that the job leads to a desirable future. They define the `self-managed work team' which differs from the traditional concept of a `work group' in that planning, organisation, prioritising and staffing are undertaken by the team rather than by a supervisor. The team will usually take responsibility for an area of work and the level of autonomy may vary. Activities are normally interdependent and team members may be multi-skilled to enable interchangeability between them. As well as having those attributes previously mentioned, the team is identifiable in that it has defined boundaries within a larger social system and the member roles are differentiated \cite{Hackman1990}. 

\label{text:theorieslist}Since the 1970s, the Work System has received mention in the field of \IS{}, for example \citeA{Alter2001,Alter2002,Alter2002a,Alter2003,Alter2004,Alter2004a,Alter2004b,Alter2005,Alter2006,AlterDennis2002,BostromHeinen1979,BostromHeinen1979a,Martin2004,MitchellZmud1999,Mumford1983,MumfordWeir1979,Orlikowski2001,Rasmussen1992,RyanBock1991,Sutcliffe2000}, plus others. \citeA{BostromHeinen1979, BostromHeinen1979a} refer to the Work System in an attempt to understand why so many Management Information Systems (\textsc{mis}) have failed and to propose a new method of systems design, the Socio-Technical System (\textsc{sts}), which is distinct from sociotechnical theory. \cbstart{}\textsc{sts} arose from the recognition that new systems implementation projects in the mid-twentieth century were being confounded by workers who mistrusted the motives of company managers, and by cost and time overruns during development. A solution that binds the technical and social subsystems within the organisation is proposed, where the technical subsystem comprises the devices and tools that add economic value to the organisation and the social subsystem comprises organisational hierarchy, employees (at all levels), their knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and needs. Later, the environmental subsystem was incorporated to include external organisational factors. The key to \textsc{sts} is the application of a design process that ensures all the systems are working in harmony. This can only be achieved when the interdependency between subsystems is explicitly recognised. Thus, the design of any system is required to take into account the effect of impact between subsystems.\cbend{}

\cbstart{}\citeA{BostromHeinen1979, BostromHeinen1979a}\cbend{} refer to the Work System in its broadest sense\cbstart{}:\cbend{} as a means for allocating work tasks to workers in a defined sub-system within an organisation or as an example, a department. In the same year \citeA{MumfordWeir1979} use the term in reference to design principles, and \citeA{DavisTaylor1979} extend its meaning somewhat to include elements of social systems. They make the assumption that Work Systems exist within social systems rather than in a strictly organisational context and that a person has the power to create or otherwise organise those social systems. Later, \citeA{Trist1981} offers a definition that reflects Taylor's own conception when writing about the evolution of Mumford and Weir's \textsc{sts} and extends it with the view that ``the primary work system\dots{} may include more than one face-to-face group along with others in matrix and network clusters''~\citeyear[p.~35]{Trist1981}. \citeA{RyanBock1991} define it as one that does work, that is any purposeful activity specified to be done in an organisation. The work to be done might require the efforts of one or more people, using one or more tools, to complete one or more tasks. 

By the end of the twentieth century the meaning of the Work System had changed significantly, such that it bore little resemblance to Taylor's originating conception:\label{text:litev.taylor} 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item The scientific selection of workers; 
\item the equal division of labour; and, 
\item the training and development of workers. 
\end{inparaenum} 
\cbstart{}Taylor's\cbend{} precepts for an effective Work System\cbdelete{} are: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item A system can be created and designed, such that the worker exercises no power in its management; 
\item workers are taught a sequence of simple and repetitive tasks; and, 
\item that the worker is therefore entirely expendable.  
\end{inparaenum}
Now the Work System has come to mean: \cbstart{}a\cbend{} set of activities contributing to an integrated whole, not as a set of individual jobs and that Work should be regulated by its members and not by external supervisors \cbstart{}\cite{Mumford1983}.\cbend{} \citeA{Land2000} takes the socially aware approach still further by saying that redefining the Work System ought to lead to the improvement of the quality of working life. 

Taking a more technical approach, \citeA{SumnerRyan1994} discuss possible reasons for the difficulty in implementing \textsc{case} tools in some development  projects. They claim that one of the principal causes is that \textsc{case} tools do not fit with an existing Work System. In their discussion, they address the Work System conception identified by \citeA{BostromHeinen1979, BostromHeinen1979a} as a means of allocating work tasks to workers in a defined subsystem. Whereas, \citeA{MitchellZmud1999} use the Work System as an undefined, generic concept. They appear to assume that the Work System is nothing more than an organisational construct. 

\citeA{Rasmussen1992} takes a pragmatic stance against the tendency to pass off the responsibility for identifying changes that are required to those who are, arguably, the least likely to know. \cbstart{}\citeauthor{Rasmussen1992} says\cbend{} the human-work interface needs to be designed to match user needs and requirements and that adaptations to the interface ought to reflect any new Work System, however the design cannot be based on existing work practice, nor can users be asked to judge the quality of a design they have not yet adapted their Work System to. 

\linelabel{ll63}As the Work System has changed, so too have the worlds in which the term has been used. The measure of change can be seen in new or different technologies that emerge through time, and the emergence of new technologies has not been constant or consistent. Even during the period of development of new systems, the world in which the development is taking place can have changes effected from external and internal causes. In the process of development of an information system, it is often necessary to build an abstraction of reality and model processes so that phenomena and events that occur in various worlds can be appropriately translated into the virtualised environment of the computer system.\linelabel{ll63a} \citeA{RyanBock1991} say that systems are designed in relatively unstable environments and change is difficult, if not impossible, to predict. Thus, models, by necessity, tend to be based on a snapshot of a perceived reality rather than a transitive pattern of events because of the difficulty associated with modelling a dynamic environment. \citeA[p.~311]{Alter2006} says \cbdelete{}``a different definition of Work System leads to a different model.'' To appreciate the effect of change \citeA{Alter2003} says that the Work System terminology he created ought to be inherited by \IS{} projects, value chains, and supply chains. In his assertion, \IT{} is increasingly being applied to automate work practices or support and control them in real time. Thus, the \IS{} field needs to grow and encompass the wider concept of the Work System, rather than concentrating on the \IT{} artefact that is espoused by \citeA{Orlikowski2001}. \label{text:litrev:artefact}

\section{Alter's description of the Work System} \label{sec:AltersWorkSystem}
\nobreak
\cbstart{}On the subject of the Work System in \is{}, Alter has \cbdelete{}had more to say than any other author.\cbend{} In this section is a brief summary of principal theories presented by Alter in the past eleven years. 

\label{text:LitReview:Alter}\citeA{Alter2002a} defines the Work System as a view of Work, which occurs within a purposeful system, whose goals are to produce desired results and perform Work efficiently, where Work is the effort \cbdelete{}applied to accomplish something. In order to understand a Work System, Alter has created the Work System Framework (Figure~\ref{fig:WorkSystemFrameWork}), a model that is used to organise an initial understanding of how a Work System operates and what it is required to accomplish. Alter's Work System refers not only to technological \IT{} artefacts, it may also include any kind of technology that allows a system to achieve its goals. 

\begin{figure}[th] %  figure placement: here or top

   \caption[Work System Framework]{Work System Framework: \emph{\protect\citeNP<Source,>[p.~93]{Alter2002a}}.} \label{fig:WorkSystemFrameWork}
\end{figure}

Work Systems exist in an organisation, and an organisation can be defined as multiple Work Systems coordinated to reach goals that an individual Work System cannot achieve. To achieve these goals, a Work System is generally comprised of a series of steps (a business process or work practice). \citeA{Alter2002} defines two states for a Work System\cbstart{}:\cbend{} static and dynamic. The static view describes a Work System in which there is no variance in its environment, whereas the dynamic view illustrates how a Work System adjusts to environmental changes that may be planned or not. To understand these changes Alter refers to the Work System Lifecycle. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:WorkSystemFrameWork}, the Work System is that part of the figure that is shaded, the rest is included to create the context in which the Work System is active and identifies external factors that may influence it. The figure contains elements that comprise the framework and which have been defined in Table~\vref{tab:WorkSystemElements}. The framework allows a person to understand the relations that exist within and without the Work System and to derive possible changes.

\end{figure}

\newpage{}The Work System Lifecycle in Figure~\vref{fig:WorkSystemLifecycle} has undergone changes since it was published in the first edition of \citeA{Alter2002}. A revised version appeared in \citeA{Alter2001} that added \emph{iterations}, then in \citeyear{Alter2002a} \emph{unanticipated opportunities} and \emph{adaptations} were \cbdelete{}added. The net result, Alter says, is that the model conforms to a range of models referred to in \IS{} literature and deals with innovation, experimentation, adaptation, emergent change, path dependence, opportunities and assimilation gaps. Figure~\vref{fig:WorkSystemLifecycle} illustrates that when a project \emph{initiation} is granted, a new or revised Work System has been envisaged. That is, operational goals will need to have been set such that resources (including time) can be allocated and the planned system satisfies feasibility tests (at least economic, operational, and technical). When these criteria \cbstart{}met,\cbend{} the project may be allowed to go into the \emph{development} phase. The steps in this process include:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item The writing of detailed requirements for the new or revised information system and Work System; 
\item either or both for acquiring an existing software system and possibly modifying it or producing the code for a new system; 
\item selecting, acquiring, and installing hardware as required; 
\item creating documentation as required from the outset, and producing training materials; 
\item testing of all the previous and where necessary, debugging it. 
\end{inparaenum}
If, during the development phase evidence is presented that demonstrates the project is not feasible, then the project is referred back to the initiation phase. 

When the development phase is complete, the project can move onto the \emph{implementation} phase and sets out to implement the system that was planned. The major processes include:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item The selection of which type of implementation approach to take, 
\item plan for change management issues and take steps to deal with positive and negative impacts of change, 
\item manage and provide training for participants in the new or changed information system and Work System, 
\item transition to the new information system or Work System, 
\item manage acceptance testing before the system is fully rolled out. 
\end{inparaenum}
If there are any issues preventing the effective roll out of the new system, then it is referred back to the development phase. If acceptance testing provides sufficient evidence that the system is ready for full deployment, the system goes into the \emph{operation and maintenance} phase. This phase requires the Work System to be monitored for performance to ensure it is delivering on its promised goals\cbstart{}: Any\cbend{} minor flaws in the information system and/or Work System are addressed and corrected as a normal part of their maintenance\cbstart{}, for example,\cbend{} on-going improvement of work practices through analysis, experimentation, and adaptation. At some, point the revised Work System will come under \emph{review} when a decision is made to continue unchanged, with modification, or the project terminated. If the choice is made to continue with modification, the cycle starts over at the \emph{initiation} phase. 

In any of these four phases, a project may be hijacked by \emph{unanticipated opportunities} or \emph{adaptations.} These may take the form of \IT{} innovations arising and then acquired by the organisation but may only be \cbstart{}sparsely deployed:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item experimentation by any participant in the development process, 
\item adaptation of current or proposed technology, 
\item emergent change that may affect the Work System or the technology it uses, 
\item pre-existing organisational path dependencies which both constrain its choices and shape its actions, 
\item forming limited windows of opportunity, and 
\item assimilation gaps (the apparent gap that appears as \IT{} artefacts\label{text:litrev:artefact1} are acquired but not actually deployed). 
\end{inparaenum}\cbend{}

In application, \citeA{Alter2002} defines three generic steps (listed in Table~\vref{tab:pbmsa}) in the Principle Based Method of Systems Analysis (\textsc{pbmsa}):
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item Define the Work System and the problem or opportunity; 
\item use the nine principles to explore the Work System elements in turn to identify possible improvements (this may reveal additional problems not considered initially); 
\item after identifying the possibilities, decide how to address the problem or opportunity without worsening perceived problems and make recommendations based on fundamental concepts used in \IS{} and systems engineering practice. 
\end{inparaenum}

\newpage{}In Alter's \citeyear{Alter2002} view, an analysis of a Work System includes decisions that are made on where to focus development or change. Such choices place emphasis on particular elements, potentially at the cost of others. If the bias is towards pleasing the customers then the emphasis will be on the elements \emph{please the customer,} and \emph{products and services.} With a bias on satisfying the needs of the participant, the emphasis will be placed on the \cbstart{}\emph{participant}\cbend{} first, then \emph{business processes} and \emph{information.} Putting the bias on technological development \cbstart{}first places emphasis on \emph{technology,} then \emph{business processes} and \emph{information.}\cbend{} In each case, some elements will not be fully addressed. What the decision making processes also indicate is that in an analysis of a Work System choices need to be made about how much to invest and in what sector. \citeauthor{Alter2002} says that there are limited resources for development and not all elements can be given all that they are due. 

When the Work System has been described, issues identified, and possible solutions put forward, recommendations can be made. Not all recommendations are feasible and those that are considered would need to pass tests of economic, operational, and technical feasibility. Each recommendation would be required to address proposed changes in each element of the work system\cbstart{}. Any\cbend{} other related systems, provide rationale for changes, list alternatives and why they were not considered as options, identification of at least all primary and secondary stake holders and how the changes will affect them (positive and negative influences), and a project plan that includes a preliminary timetable of deliverables \cite{Alter2002a}. 

In the first step, the business professional or analyst is likely to find that the problem or system they need to assess has not been well defined. \citeA{Alter2002a} says \cbstart{}there seems to be a common misinterpretation of what constitutes a system. Whether\cbend{} it refers to those elements that comprise a Work System as a view of Work which occurs within a purposeful system, and whose goals are to produce desired results and perform Work efficiently, including human or technological participants, information or data, technology as required, and business processes; or the combination of software and hardware that comprise an information system to which users and applications of it, are incidental. \linelabel{ll182}The corollary to this is that the scope of the analysis is dependent upon how the system being analysed is understood and therefore, any improvements to be made may be applied to the Work System or the information system, and so debate may emerge as to what it is that actually requires change. \linelabel{ll182a}

\linelabel{ll185}In relation to the scope of an analysis, it is necessary for the investigation to quickly identify those areas where change is required and focus on what needs improvement \cite{Alter2002}. To facilitate this, Alter has devised his Work System Snapshot which should not require more than one page. The Snapshot lists customers (internal and external), products and services produced by the Work System under investigation, a limited number of business processes (to keep the analysis manageable), human and technological participants, information used, technology required to facilitate the Work System, a short description or list of items that constitute the context or business environment, technological applications that link the Work System with others, and the strategic position of this Work System and the organisation as a whole. 

In the second, step the Work System has been positively identified and any issues arising should start to present themselves. The step is largely exploratory, and so it is likely that there will be alternative solutions presented to resolve problems or take advantage of opportunities as they are presented. \citeA{Alter2002} points out that it is altogether too easy to jump from problem to solution in this phase, especially when those engaged in the process have their favourite technological or computerised solution that can be applied to all similar problems, regardless of what the problem is. \citeauthor{Alter2002} suggests that, from his experience, if groups exist who oppose each other with their own favoured solutions to any/all problems, a factionalised situation may rapidly emerge. People will begin to argue why their solution is\cbstart{}best and the problems that need to be solved are quickly forgotten.\cbend{} The situation can worsen if the only solution that is then recommended is technological or computerised when the argument focussed on the choice of this information system or that, not whether an information system is required or if there were alternatives such as a redesign of the business processes. The \textsc{pbmsa} is intended to prevent this kind of situation from occurring. 

\linelabel{ll190}Depending on which version of the \textsc{pbmsa} one is referring to, there may be 9 or 21 principles used to guide the analyst. Table~\vref{tab:pbmsa} represents Alter's vision in 2002 and his updated view is illustrated in Table~\vref{tab:ExtendedWSPrinciples}. In the intervening period between 2002 and 2004 omissions in Alter's method became apparent.

\linelabel{ll237}\textls[12]{The initial method arose from Alter's own experience at Consilium. He says \citeyear{Alter2004} the approach is directed at business professionals and not necessarily software engineers. The approach should provide an overview of a current system so that recommendations can be posited. The whole process needs to exist at the conceptual development phase and does not necessarily have a place beyond that. The requirement in the \textsc{pbmsa} for widespread and at times in-depth information may lead to a paralysing effect on the analysis.}

Weaknesses in the early version \cite<see examples in,>{Alter2004, Alter2004a, Alter2004b, Alter2006, AlterDennis2002} \cbstart{}have\cbend{} drawn comparisons with, for example socio-technical systems. The result is that the new version of the \textsc{pbmsa} borrows liberally from socio-technical principles. These are well founded from both a practical and theoretical perspective but creating a force-fit with the \textsc{pbmsa} produces conflicts and lacks coherence in parts. \linelabel{ll240}

\citeA{Alter2002} says the level at which a Work System exists may be well below the organisational level. If the Work System is operational in emphasis, the analyst may not be able to adequately interpret organisational strategies so that the Work System supports organisational goals. He says that if strategic goals and forecasts are documented in, for example, an annual report or are represented in the organisation's mission statement strategies may not be easily translated for application in the Work System. An example that illustrates the apparent break in awareness\cbdelete{} described is a Work System that provides accounts payable authentication. An accounting system is required to ensure payment requests, creditor invoices, match purchase orders and that the necessary information for the creditor exist. At an operational level, the participant is far removed from overarching organisational strategies. More generalised Work Systems that exist at a strategic level may be influenced by such concerns, but it may also be argued that at such a high level the scope for them is too broad to be considered feasible. \linelabel{ll243}\cbdelete{} Alter's \cbdelete{}\textsc{pbmsa} does not scale well, neither adequately providing required detail for operational activities \cbdelete{}(for example it could be said that accounts processes tend to be standardised as a statutory requirement rather than because they fit corporate mission statements), nor offering a procedural approach to the establishment of corporate strategies.\linelabel{ll243a}

\section{The Work System in \IS{}} \label{sec:WSInISDevelopment}
\vspace{-1em}
In \S{}\ref{sec:WSInISDevelopment:ontCons}, I argue that how \linelabel{ll248}an ontological conception of a Work System is built is dependent upon how the world is classified. This will determine the kind of information system that can be developed. That is, the actual world presents limitations to how abstracted conceptions can be created, thus information systems designed to conduct Work represent attempts at building the actual in other worlds.\linelabel{ll248a} Here, reference to `worlds' is in the sense that \citeA{Heidegger1972} uses the term. \linelabel{ll248b}The disclosure of the `world' for the researcher is their attempt at making sense of phenomena and so their conception of a disclosed world is dependent upon the context in which they find the actual world the researcher is concerned about. Thus, the researcher categorises their knowledge of the disclosed world based upon their experiences and held understandings of the actual world.\linelabel{ll248c}

In \S{}\ref{sec:WSInISDevelopment:methCons}, conceptions of Work Systems from \citeA{RyanBock1991} and \citeA{Alter2003} result in methodological approaches that make the design of information systems a complex and somewhat arbitrary exercise. These authors have been selected in particular because of their special reference to the Work System and their attempts at describing methodologies for designing information systems that reflect phenomena found in the organisation.

\subsection{Ontology considerations} \label{sec:WSInISDevelopment:ontCons}
\nobreak
\linelabel{ll256}\label{text:litrev.ontology}\cbdelete{}Ontology is defined here as a representation of knowledge by a set of concepts within a natural domain. Ontology is concerned with the nature of being and existence, and the categorisation of objects and establishing relations between them.\footnote{\cbstart{}Compare this with the definition in footnote \ref{text:litrev.ontology1} on page \pageref{text:litrev.ontology1}.\cbend{}}\linelabel{ll256a} \citeA{Peirce1992a}\cbdelete{} says if one is able to conceive of the existence of objects through experimentation and experience, one is then able to classify them according to predefined criteria. \linelabel{ll256b}\cbstart{}Through\cbend{} including relationships between concepts, \cbdelete{}ontology is used to reason about the domain's properties. \cbstart{}The ontology\cbend{} may be used to describe objects. How \cbdelete{}ontology is conceived varies, being dependent upon the environment into which systems \cbstart{}thus\cbend{} implemented and ontologies are situational.\linelabel{ll256c}

\cbstart{}In any \IS{} development or design project, understanding of both the organisation, and the system under investigation need to be shared \cite{Checkland1997}. For example,\cbend{} those systems designed for the accounting focussed business environment are designed with transaction control and processing in mind, that reflect the company's business processes, and often utilise the double entry approach to financial, management, and cost accounts. The Accounting Information System (\textsc{ais}) is clearly definable by its sets of processes and flows of data and \cbstart{}the\cbend{} faith instilled in its predictability is observable in \cbstart{}its\cbend{} widespread use.\cbdelete{} This is not necessarily true of all other types of system, for example the Judicial Decision Support System (\textsc{jdss}) is not so well conceived, partly because the way in which laws are enacted, \cbstart{}makes\cbend{} it difficult to define processes that may be applied across implementations.

\citeA{Henham2000} says the approach applied to information systems for handling legal sentencing decisions, or sentencing law, in which the rules to be followed may not be based solely on \cbstart{}precedents. Each\cbend{} case is assessed on its own merits, judges have a reasonably broad discretion to include mitigating factors, and sentences may be changed because of guidelines that have been passed down from the Court of Appeal. A dilemma is created in which those who are tasked with making correct decisions about cases are hampered by the vast number of cases that need to be addressed and how to make decisions when faced with seemingly similar cases and the guidelines from the Court of Appeal. To resolve this dilemma, some researchers have considered addressing sociological aspects in the development of sets of rules or heuristics \cite<for example,>{Hutton1995}, whereas others have considered a more positivist approach \cite<for example,>{Zeleznikow1994}. The same problems can be observed in other \IS{} design and development projects that incorporate semi- or unstructured problems. 

Library Information Science (\textsc{lis}) has adopted a pragmatist view of knowledge \cite{Hjorland2006} despite evidence that positivism still dominates the thinking of researchers \cite{Hjorland2005}. The pragmatist approach is concurrent with the societal role of institutions, regardless of whether the libraries are private or public \cite{Sundin2005}. Dewey has influenced the evolution of library classification where, for example, identifying that a single object can be understood to have meanings that are related to several real world occurrences and that these are detached from any organisational structure. 
\begin{quotation}
[T]here is a genuine objective standard for the goodness of special classifications\dots{} The teleological theory of classification does not therefore commit us to the notion that classes are purely verbal or purely mental. Organisation is no more merely nominal or mental in any art, including the art of inquiry, than it is in a department store or railway system. The necessity of execution supplies objective criteria. Things have to be sorted out and arranged so that their grouping will promote successful action for ends. Convenience, economy and efficiency are the bases of classification, but these things are not restricted to verbal communication with others nor to inner consciousness; they concern objective action. They must take effect in the world. \hfill{}\citeA[p.~151]{Dewey1948}
\end{quotation}

\cbstart{}Therefore,\cbend{} differing conceptions of what constitutes Work Systems, or at least the Work done in them, has resulted in a more or less two-pronged approach to systems design and implementation; to provide physical access to material objects, and to direct users to certain thoughts and ideas \cite{Huang2006}. 

\subsection{Methodological considerations} \label{sec:WSInISDevelopment:methCons}\linelabel{ll272}
\nobreak
\citeA{RyanBock1991} identify the Work System as a basic unit of analysis in sociotechnical systems theory. Citing Trist, they say that work organisations exist to do work and that such work must involve people using technological artefacts to complete tasks that are intended to meet organisational goals and that such organisations can be studied at various levels. The levels at which an organisation can be studied include the macro-social or societal level, the organisation as a whole, or at the primary Work System level\cbdelete{} and below. The Work System is the bounded sub-system of an organisation\cbstart{}, its task is\cbend{} to carry out activities that have been set for it. \cbdelete{}Components of a Work System can be added or removed, as required which may cause linkages within or between Work Systems to break. They say that breakages can also occur as the environment in which a Work System exists changes, leading to incompatibilities between it and other Work Systems such that the facilities provided by the system become unavailable, incompatible, non-functioning, or lost. 

In addressing the expectation of unplanned change \citeA{Alter2003} accepts that change exists within the environment when he says that Work Systems exist in a particular form during a particular interval of time and that changes in a Work System's state may occur during that interval, without significantly changing the Work System's form. \cbstart{}This begs the question:\cbend{} will not those same incremental changes amount to significant variations within a Work System? The Work System is subject to both planned and unplanned individual, departmental, and organisational variations in process and in this regard the environment is dynamic, but \linelabel{ll278}the model is limited in forecasting power\cbdelete{} and brings into question the viability of it as a model for system-wide development. \linelabel{ll278a}

In a hypothetical comparison between three generalised approaches, \citeA{Alter2004b} compares a range from ethnographic qualitative methods: \cbstart{}Interpretative\cbend{} Workplace Studies (\textsc{iwps}), positivist quantitative methods termed Traditional Information System Design (\textsc{tisd}), and his own \textsc{wsm}. The former method has a strong emphasis on human factors in systems design and is possibly better suited as a guide for developers in making decisions about design problems, whereas \textsc{tisd} tends towards technological solutions and produces specific, prescriptive requirements for systems design. Alter says \textsc{wsm} inhabits the middle ground between the two and while it is less detail oriented, it is \cbdelete{}more prescriptive than, say, Soft Systems Methodology \cite{Checkland1999}. However, since \textsc{wsm} bases its assumptions on a snapshot of a system, organisation, or process, it may fail to represent changes in the resulting system. To counter this, Alter created the Work System Lifecycle model \cbstart{}that\cbend{} is supposed to address issues of change through the application of a simplified iterative development cycle. 

Alter's admission that the Work System Method (\textsc{wsm}) is useful at the early stage of a project and that the approach has only been applied by researchers rather than on real live applications that involve developing or modifying systems in organisations adds further weight to the doubt.

Work Systems exist in dynamic environments but consider a situation in which a stable Work System exists in a static environment. In order for a Work System to function it needs to interface with its nearest neighbours and \citeA{RyanBock1991} cite a Work System with seven components; two people using two tools to perform three tasks. They say the number of possible interfaces for a single Work System can amount to $(\frac{n!}{2})-1$ where $n$ is the number of distinct components in the Work System. The systems designer may have to discount up to 2519 potentially meaningful interfaces. There is the possibility that a quantity of these interfaces may be sufficiently similar for them to be aggregated, but such a choice can only be made once they have been identified and classified. The number of interfaces has the potential to get very large very quickly, and for even a simple Work System this would be unwieldy. \cbstart{}However,\cbend{} the environment in which Work Systems exist is not static, it is dynamic and \citeauthor{RyanBock1991} suggest building a degree of flexibility into the Work System to deal with the complexity, to make more use of individual interfaces.

The Work System Lifecycle model \citeA{Alter2003} illustrates, shows how a Work System's state may change through various iterations of a development project. The model identifies the steps involved for planned changes with sufficient flexibility for unplanned changes. \cbdelete{}Alter's model provides an allowance that deviates from highly structured approaches, referring to such variations as `requirements creep' or `non-conformance' and generally seeks to prevent such activities. In a more controlled manner \citeA{RyanBock1991} propose a method for determining the degree of flexibility present in a Work System through its internal linkages (people, tools, and tasks). \cbdelete{}\linelabel{ll284}


\section{Impact of new technologies on Work} \label{sec:ImpactOfTech}
\nobreak
\linelabel{ll289}Web 2.0 presents a distinct era in the history of the Internet where Work \cbstart{}may\cbend{} become\cbdelete{} more participatory, with applications that allow a person to create and publish their own content without having to concern themselves with building and maintaining a web presence.\linelabel{ll289a} The uptake of new technologies in the social and business context suggests some impact on how work is thought about or achieved. Common examples are forums, wikis, and blogs that enable na\"i{}ve users to publish content through \cbstart{}applications\cbend{} of templates and preset options whereas knowledgeable users are able to develop sophisticated applications that reuse existing data and to build new information sources.

Sometimes referred to as the Semantic Web, Web 2.0 stems from the efforts of the grassroots of the programming community and has evolved to fill the immediate needs of developers and users by creating artefacts\label{text:litrev:artefact2} that are programmable, lightweight, and directly usable despite inherent flaws \cite{Wilde2007}. The term is attributed to \cbdelete{}\citeA{Oreilly2005} but was actually coined by \citeA{DiNucci1999}. Web 2.0 allows for immediate application by \cbstart{}technologically advanced\cbend{} users who can bypass the \IT{} department with its perceived restrictions and time delays, to build mash-ups that create new information or get an instant view of who has published what inside the enterprise \cite{Milojcic2007}. The Semantic Web on the other hand, is a concept that has its roots in Artificial Intelligence and academia \cite<see, for example>{Dietrich2007}\cbstart{}:\cbend{} perhaps a reason why the uptake has been relatively limited compared with Web 2.0 technologies \cite{Maximilien2007}.

\linelabel{ll294}In the organisational context, Web 2.0 is something of a solution looking for a problem and as such, businesses have the opportunity to demonstrate business intelligence and generate value from information using Services Oriented Architectures (\textsc{soa}) and Web 2.0 \cite<for example,>{Castro2007, Evans2007, Lin2006, Sur2007, White2006}. \linelabel{ll294a}

There has been some resistance to the implementation of Web 2.0 technologies in the enterprise \cite{Fojt2009, Havenstein2007a}. Sporadic attempts at making applications acceptable to \IT{} departments, for example using Web 2.0 technologies in local and central government to disseminate planning information to stake-holders and giving organisations, companies, the public\cbdelete{} or individuals the opportunity to make comment directly \cite{Steins2008} have been made. \cbdelete{}

In business, predominant issues often concern cost cutting, resource maximisation, or product or service differentiation as a counter to perceived competitive forces. To achieve these goals, applications of Web 2.0 technologies used in, for example, increasing efficiencies in the supply chain by integrating disparate systems and improving information interchange \cite{He2007}. A seemingly popular option is to apply the principles of Software as a Service (SaaS) to Web 2.0 technologies \cite{Goh2007}. But \citeA{Virtue2009}  says there needs to be a balance between risk and opportunity to mitigate the possible effects of security attacks, a decline in employee productivity, and Human Resource, and legal problems while \citeA{Santos2009} says participants must at some point deal with the ethical issues associated with these.

While there is an increasing volume of published research on the technological aspects of Web 2.0 and how applications can be implemented, there is relatively little research undertaken on the impact of newer technologies on Work or Work Systems. Significant company mergers have taken place, major marketing campaigns that involve social networking applications, political battles conducted on public forums, and militant organisations that gain international support by distributing recordings of their messages \cite{Constantinides2008}. \linelabel{ll302}There is thus, the suggestion that events in the world are outstripping the efforts of researchers to form new theories of understanding of how new technologies affect\cbdelete{} social, managerial, and operational factors in Work.\linelabel{ll302a}

There has been experimentation with Web 2.0 technologies in the business context \cite<for example,>{Koch2007, Rowe2006, Yi2006} but as with anything new, anecdotal concerns from businesses have been raised. Some concerns expressed include security, return on investment, and staff skills in implementing and integrating new technologies with legacy systems \cite{Hoover2007}. In a perfect world, Web 2.0 would be represented by a consistent level of semantic interoperability\cbstart{}. Applications\cbend{} would share services or, where necessary, update themselves and universally applied standards would be implemented \cite{BernersLee1998}. Given this perfect state of being, historical problems associated with the integration of heterogeneous environments would be somewhat alleviated \cite{Kobielus2007}. Despite this, it is becoming a predominant paradigm in the development of distributed software systems because web services provide the potential for software to be modularised in a way that functionality can be described, discovered and deployed in a platform independent manner over a network \cite{Bell2007}. 

\citeA{Butler2003} says that users of Internet-\ and Intranet-based information systems interact with them in ways that are often different or new. He says there is a rising expectation among some users that they can add, change, or update content in real time and it seems a prime requirement is to be able to have direct access to the latest data or content and as such, direct access to components of an organisations value chain. Having a high level of access is seen as a given along with the ability to make changes to or reconfigure internal processes. \cbstart{}\citeA{McKeller2008} says there is a\cbend{} new generation of business professionals \cbstart{}who\cbend{} are arriving with \cbdelete{}expectations that Web 2.0 applications are already available. To support these users, there has been research on Service Discovery Protocols (\textsc{sdp}s) to provide functionality for establishing ad hoc associations between service providers and service requesters~\cite{BenMokhtar2008}. The problem with this system is that different people will not agree on exactly how to define all concepts. Any computer application that tries to standardise its ontology will necessarily distort what at least some people are trying to express~\cite{Jones2008}. An additional risk facing \IT{} departments is having information that falls into the wrong hands due to a lack of careful governance of user activity~\cite{McKeller2008}. 

Decision making within organisations takes various forms but are typically classified according the traditional hierarchy of $strategy \Leftrightarrow tactical \Leftrightarrow operations$ that became popular after the Second World War. This organisational structure relies on a flow of information from the operational level up so that decisions can be made and passed down. \linelabel{ll309}The productionist chain of command comes under threat when operational staff arrive with the belief that they have the intellectual capacity and sufficient access to information with which to make decisions collectively.\linelabel{ll309a} Web 2.0 may represent a collective intelligence\cbstart{}, but it\cbend{} is more likely seen as a set of tools that allow for collective bargaining, argument, and decision-making \cite{Gruber2008}. The use of new technologies on the Web has created a field of some intellectual freedom in which opinions and argument can be presented in discussion forums, blogs, news sites, wikis and has enabled the application of large-scale argumentation, where different views are presented, challenged, and evaluated by contributors and readers \cite{Rahwan2007}. \cbstart{}In the classic organisational context where decisions and corporate information are essentially top-down and information flow is upward, wikis that employ a social networking approach have begun to change how people perceive information and knowledge~\cite{White2007}. \cbend{}\cbdelete{}

As a platform for supporting various kinds of argumentation, the influence of Web 2.0 on the enterprise has begun to be felt by \IT{} departments and managerial decision makers \cite{Kazikawa2007} and to challenge traditional institutional boundaries by drawing the decision making power down from higher levels of management and giving greater autonomy to teams who can communicate openly. Open communication can occur if close linkages between a variety of communication tools and job systems exist \cite{Shiumazu2007} and where frameworks are in place to support their development. 

It has become apparent in \IT{} departments that users are \cbstart{}accessing\cbend{} consumer sites and even sharing corporate digital assets with those outside accepted corporate margins or boundaries. Therefore, organisations must reassess their management strategies in relation to digital assets \cite{Swisher2007}. Problems that can occur include loss of intellectual capital, breaches of copyright, and possession of others' intellectual capital without the rights to have it. Such risks turn to threats when the enterprise can be liable for the actions of employees, even though it may have been through ignorance \cite{Garland2008}. 

\newpage{}Other growth restrictions exist too, for example, there is still much work required in the development of ontologies,\footnote{\label{text:litrev.ontology1}\cbstart{}Similar to the prior definition of ontology on page \pageref{text:litrev.ontology}, the term here is defined to mean the representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. \cbdelete{}Ontology in this context can be used to describe a domain and thus reason about the entities within it.\cbend{}} for example the modelling of business domains, authoring of software to implement the models, and the identification of best practises and guidelines to ensure consistent quality and performance~\cite{Leger2006}. However, some work can be alleviated through the re-use of existing ontologies. Knowledge extraction remains an ongoing and complex problem, that is, when ontologies have been identified or created having them populated with knowledge extracted from legacy data is at best difficult without an appropriate tool set. One solution to the problem is through mapping to overcome heterogeneity but that assumes a static, non-changing environment and is only \cbdelete{}usable when transferring data and does not suit the dynamic Web 2.0 situation. \citeauthor{Leger2006} state that at this time, most applications that use Web 2.0 to cross-link data to create new or different data suffers from a lack of scalability, and that limits its potential and performance. \cbdelete{}

It is the norm that in an enterprise, information is stored in structured databases and as unstructured files that often have no meaningful relationships either with other files or the structured databases. Meaning attributed to a range of unstructured files may be held by users who interact with them, and a difficulty arises when that link is lost through the departure of a key person from the file's relative context (they may leave the organisation, the department, or the project or job). The social networking nature of Web 2.0 permits the collection of metadata for files and instantiations of data, so when a person vacates their relationship with a file, they leave a trace of their knowledge about the information the file contains, which adds substantially to the file's meaning. The downside is that the application of metadata suffers from the peculiarities of the individual user, who may be the person who created the information or a subsequent visitor who adds metadata for their own purposes \cite<also referred to as folksonomy, see>{Smith2004}.

In smaller development projects, what may be seen as a limitation (that of scalability) may in fact be an advantage. For example~\citeA{Auer2007} make the claim that wikis are capable of handling vast amounts of information, in many cases \cbstart{}ad hoc\cbend{} ontologies can be created by \cbdelete{}users,\cbdelete{} and the increased interlinking possibilities means that greater value can be extracted from the stored information. Downscaling the concept may also have other benefits, for example, in a team based Work System where there are limited participants and the content is highly focussed. Clustering is another approach that can bring the volume of potential relationships down significantly, especially with the use of Artificial Intelligence concepts~\cite{Tenenbaum2006}. 

\section{Explication of Work in the Work System} \label{sec:Explication}
\nobreak
\cbstart{}Previously, it has been said that by\cbend{} the end of the twentieth century, the meaning of the Work System has changed significantly\cbstart{}. The Work System\cbend{} bears little resemblance to Taylor's originating conception\footnote{See page \pageref{text:litev.taylor}.}\cbdelete{} Now it has come to mean a set of activities contributing to an integrated whole, and not as a set of individual jobs, and borrowing from \citeA{Trist2000}, that it should be regulated by its members, not by external supervisors \cite{Mumford1983}.\cbdelete{}

Taylor's \cbstart{}conception of the Work System\footnote{See page \pageref{text:intro.Taylor}.}\cbend{} was sufficient to envisage workers as no more than economic units that needed to be exploited in the most efficient manner, to get the best level of productivity out of them. \linelabel{ll325}The strength of the Scientific Management method is that this thing called `science' could be put to use to increase profit margins with no requirement to display affinity or empathy for fellow creatures. Moral and ethical issues are left for those with time on their hands, because in industry they present \cbdelete{}an impediment to profit. \linelabel{ll325a}

\cbstart{}The statement: ``[The] victory of science is not what distinguishes our nineteenth century, but instead the victory of scientific method over science'' \cite[p.~148]{Nietzsche1968} serves to highlight Taylor's callous stance. \linelabel{ll329}\cbdelete{}In Nietzsche's paradox,\cbend{} those who would wield power and reduce the worker to little more than a machine, are \cbstart{}themselves\cbend{} no less caught up in the same machine. The acquisition of power creates a demand for more power, so that \cbstart{}the\cbend{} owners and managers of iron works and mills of the Industrial Revolution \cbstart{}maintain\cbend{} the Will to Power: the struggle to gather power, and then to use it to get more power.\linelabel{ll329a} In the twentieth century, the ``technological disclosure of entities mobilizes everything including people into the project of increasing the power of the technological system itself, all under the guise of improving the human estate'' \cite[p.~199]{Zimmerman1990}. \linelabel{ll329b}The inevitable path that the Will to Power must take is the creation of the cybernetic system: a system devoid of humanity, whose aim is the further attribution of power which can steer itself towards that goal by assimilating information and using it to achieve its aim. In the cybernetic world, total control over the living and the lifeless world means that even \cbstart{}humanity is trained. It is as though humanity were no more than a stupid machine,\cbend{} so that, in the Hegelian sense, ``work becomes thus absolutely more and more dead, it becomes machine-labour, the \cbstart{}individual's\cbend{} own skill becomes infinitely limited, and the consciousness of the factory worker is degraded to the utmost level of dullness'' \cite[p.~93]{Avineri1974}.\linelabel{ll329c}

\citeA{Marx1998} say machines \cbstart{}are no more than what they are as\cbend{} the complex means of production created to fulfil the goals of the capitalist system. In their view, the technological means for production is not of itself degrading of the worker. Therefore, to change the ownership of machines from the capitalist bosses to the workers, creates propitious conditions for the development of authentic social relations of production. \citeA{Heidegger1972} argues that, contrary to what Marx may have said, degradation is not the result of any particular economic system (the same degraded status of workers can be observed in both capitalist and communist economies), but that it is a systemic result of production in the technological era. 

\cbstart{}It is important to put machines into context:\cbend{} they are not autonomous~\cite{Heidegger1972}. Machines, a class of entity that goes beyond any single instance, are no longer owned by any person or socio-political class, but that humanity is itself subservient to the technological system. This is expressed through all parts of a person's life and can be extrapolated to incorporate the rest of society and in particular, language. \cbdelete{}Language has become an instrument serving the universal production process where local dialects are becoming overrun, \linelabel{ll334}\cbstart{}for example, by Mid-Atlantic Anglo-American that is now the de-facto universal language of modern technology.\cbend{} This results in alienation at a local level and the loss of cultural identity\cbstart{} It\cbend{} may also restrict further evolutionary development because, ``instead of letting entities show themselves appropriately through language, people in the technological era are compelled to use language to disclose things one-dimensionally'' \cite[p.~215]{Zimmerman1990}. \linelabel{ll334a}

\linelabel{ll338}Physics has made it possible for theorists like those proponents of Scientific Management to conceive of Work in a new way. Social and cultural conceptions are reframed as the relations of force, distance, and time, which in turn mean that for the worker, Work is their only reality, \linelabel{ll338a}and their ``reality is nothing but the quantity of working'' \cite[p.~148]{Heidegger1981}, so ``Work has become work for the sake of more work''~\cite[p.~215]{Zimmerman1990}. While the functionalisation of time and Work depends on the purposeful transformation of items found in the work environment, the transformation may not be made directly by the workers.\footnote{See page \pageref{text:litrev.rasmussen}.}

\citeA{Zimmerman1990} refers to the binding of the worker to the time clock in an industrial plant and how there are relatively few who are \cbstart{}adequately able to\cbend{} alter their lives to fit in with an abstracted timeframe imposed on them, where others never learn to adapt and depart to do other things. Following Taylor's principles, he says, work in industrial plants is organised according to functional processes and workers are either slotted into a production line and engage in repetitive processes or organised into production units that may be semi-autonomous. The role of the worker allows for total redundancy, the worker is entirely expendable and their function can be passed off to some other worker who is quickly trained to take their place. The reduction of the worker to a production unit is reflected in the unit being reduced to a cog in the wheels of the plant, the plant a production unit for the company, the company a production unit for the corporation, and as a throughout result, work is itself reduced and degraded. The truth of this is unpalatable and the perception not new, for example Chaplin's \citeyear{Chaplin1936} representation of a factory worker who is drawn inexorably into the workings of the machine, only to be spat out at the other end.

Heidegger counsels that resolution of the apparent problem posed by the technological era cannot be made by ``furious actions and schemes produced by the rational ego'' \cite[p.~220]{Zimmerman1990}. Instead, humanity needs to realise that there is no escape. To resolve the problem or escape from \cbstart{}the technological system\cbend{} suggests humanity has mastery over technology, which is not the case. ``We can be released from its grip only to the extent that we `recognise' that we are in its grip: this is the paradox'' \citeyear[p.~220]{Zimmerman1990}.  He says we need to ``learn to live with the realisation that artificiality is the nature of man, and that technology in all its uncommonly diverse forms, is the realised, cosmic mode of being peculiar to our nature and which must be further perfected'' \citeyear[p.~220--221]{Zimmerman1990}. ``Artificiality'' referring not to a level of shallowness in the human condition but that it is a `maker of symbols.' 

As `makers of symbols' and other abstract forms, humans have the tendency to bring to their presence ``unexpected insights, novel variations, new possibilities which reveal that it is by no means fixed but instead is open to disrupture'' \cite[p.~228]{Zimmerman1990}. \linelabel{ll344}The results are often unexpected and at times, are of benefit to more than the individual concerned and any return is thus not localised. Certain socio-political environments have the capacity to nurture this tendency in the way that they foster self-expression and provide the conditions where such expression can bear fruit. The traditional command and control management structure does not foster the capacity for self-expression or innovation from operational levels within the enterprise, relying instead on the creative powers of management and where operational staff await orders.\linelabel{ll344a} Team based organisations, where local autonomy has a place, allow for creative solutions to problems that affect staff directly. Such solutions tend to be more effective when viewed as a socio-technical system \cite{Trist2000}. In sociotechnical theory, there is a shift in emphasis away from the analysis of an individual's performance in a Work System towards teams or groups, \cbstart{}providing\cbend{} a strategy for breaking down the traditional hierarchical organisational structure. 

\cbstart{}From sociotechnical theory,\cbend{} teams or individuals in organisations that foster creative solutions to problems and the achievement of goals,\cbdelete{} demonstrate the concept of \emph{minimal critical specification} \cite{Trist2000}. Team members know what they need to achieve but are not told how they are to do it. The approach is successful because each of the teams' members have the opportunity to experience the tasks' operations, and since they experience a high level of autonomy with a high level of awareness of local conditions, they are able to react in a flexible and adaptive manner. As their experience grows through the completion of additional tasks, lessons learned are applied to new situations \cite{Rice1958}. Teams in a Work System that are effective need little monitoring, provided they produce the required outputs. \cbstart{}Therefore,\cbend{} it\cbdelete{} stands that teams that have a higher level of visibility may not be functioning as well, or they have become less reliable. 

\linelabel{ll349}Even though a Work System team may be functioning adequately, that is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case, since Work Systems exist in an environment that is dynamic and includes elements that are subject to spatiotemporal variations. Work Systems, like tools, only become highly visible when they are not functioning correctly or they have become unreliable, their output diminishes, or they conflict with other teams.\linelabel{ll349a} The analysis and treatment of Work Systems that have become dysfunctional or need improvement is what Alter has proposed in his \textsc{pbmsa}.\cbdelete{} \citeA{Checkland1997} says that in \cbstart{}any instance of an\cbend{} information systems development or design project demands there needs to be a shared understanding of both the organisation and the system under investigation, which is what an experienced analyst can bring to bear on a project.

\linelabel{ll353}\cbstart{}It has been shown that over time, what is understood to be a `Work System' has changed to in response to exigencies in the current era. Work System was seen first as a way for industrialists to get more from their workers for less. It was used to create for the worker a repetitive working environment that ensured planned obsolescence and was endlessly mundane. After its introduction, it was seen that such an existence is intolerable and efforts were made to change the lot of workers via the union movement. Now the Work System is considered as a collection of tasks performed by workers within an organisational unit, giving those workers the right to choose what they do and how.\linelabel{ll353a} Nevertheless, the Work System\cbend{} is a specific idea that applies to a specific type of environment. The Taylorist Work System describes Work undertaken in a production environment in which there are defined targets that must be achieved on a regular basis. 

\textls[12]{\IT{} \cbstart{}has wrought significant changes on the Work System since it was first conceived. The knowledge that change is taking place has led to arguments over how to deal with it without actually considering what the nature of that change is and the meaning of Work as it relates to the person. Work Systems exist within organisations, such that organisations can be defined as multiple Work Systems that are coordinated to reach goals that an individual Work System cannot achieve. In creating \IT{} artefacts, the different kinds of environment into which systems are implemented will have situational ontologies.\cbend{}}

\newpage{}In \IS{} the Work System has its place in batch processing in transaction processing systems, data gathering on production lines, call centre management systems, and so on, where the principal output are data that are stored in various ways and may be applied to various purposes. As the range and complexity of systems advance, so too does the volume of data that are being captured. This creates for the organisation a two-fold problem: how to store the data securely, and how to make sense of it in order to make coherent decisions.

\linelabel{ll360}Since the 1970s \cbstart{}information systems\cbend{} projects have led to sophisticated technologies with the purpose of extracting information from data. Large organisations are becoming successful because they can manage and extract greater value from the data they store in their various systems. Where early on the aim of information systems was simple, as automated accounting systems to facilitate the sale of more products and services to the same customers or to more customers in new and existing markets, now the goals of data use have become as complex as the systems used to store them. In organisations, there is a growing awareness that social networking sites and technologies are playing an increasing role. Web 2.0 technologies like web services provision, blogs, forums, and wikis increasingly find a place in situations where people feel the need to interact, connect, share information, and add business intelligence to data. It is incumbent upon the enterprise to decide what level or degree of access to grant to its data repositories \cbstart{}within the technological system\cbend{} and how they must be managed. \linelabel{ll360a}

The technological system, as it has become, threatens to overwhelm humanity through its size, extent, pervasiveness, and complexity. The technological system has \cbstart{}become,\cbend{} in the manner of \citeA{Nietzsche1968}, \cbdelete{}an ever increasing demand to satisfy the Will to Will, to produce for the sake of more production. \linelabel{ll362}The system has developed an apparent life of its own, and as a cybernetic system,\cbdelete{} it has become a juggernaut,\footnote{The Juggernaut is not a physical manifestation of some technological horror but the sum of the collective Will of those who participate. The reference to the juggernaut is to the colloquial English use of the term as a metaphorical force that is unstoppable and mercilessly destructive.\label{text:litrev:juggernaut}} where the person is lost and all are nameless, faceless actors in a nihilistic black comedy.\linelabel{ll362a} Proponents of technological development claim that changes wrought, herald an age of freedom from the forces of nature, but Heidegger argues that humanity is instead slave to the power \cbstart{}that\cbend{} governs all technological producing. He says that freedom is a state of subjection to the power that has reduced the former objective nature of objects to those of mere disposability, where `power' is the `being' of entities in the technological age. 

The \cbdelete{}urge to produce is the power that fuels the emergence of entities, the presencing \cbstart{}that\cbend{} compels humanity to attempt to organise everything in an endless quest for power for its own sake. Thus, humanity is drawn towards its final appearance and eventual cybernetic disclosure. \citeA{Zimmerman1990} describes the character of cybernetic systems in modern technology and how they differ from the machines of the Machine Age. \linelabel{ll366}The iron works and mills of the Industrial Revolution were owned and managed by self interested human subjects and it was them that maintained the Will to Power but in the twentieth century the technological disclosure of entities mobilises everything, natural and synthetic, into increasing the power of the technological system itself. This done under the guise of improving the human condition, and it is through this that the cybernetic form of the human is disclosed, but to itself at the end.\linelabel{ll366a}

During his trip to Greece in 1967, Heidegger expanded upon the cybernetic character of modern technology citing Nietzsche's remark from \emph{The Will to Power}~\citeyear{Nietzsche1968}, that it is the scientific method rather than the philosophy or spirit of science that is the victor over humanity. Through the positivist method, \cbstart{}\citeauthor{Nietzsche1968}\cbend{} says, the world is seen as something that can only be counted and calculated mathematically, thus the method itself has won over the philosophical foundations of science (to find the meaning of things through the use of test and experiment) and that this would result in a total revaluation of the world and its values. \cbstart{}

\cbend{}The transformation of the cybernetic human that the victorious method achieves is its goal of steering processes in a desired course. ``According to the cybernetic world projection, the basic trait of all calculable world processes is steering. Information provides the mediation necessary for one process to be steered through another. To the extent that the steered process provides information which affects the steering process, steering has the character of informational feedback''~\cite[p.~200]{Zimmerman1990}. Thus\cbstart{}, information is passed through the cybernetic system. This\cbend{} facilitates processes in control systems in electronic and mechanical devices. \linelabel{ll370}\cbstart{}Comparisons between devices and biological systems provide the ground work for advanced cybernetic systems to have the facility to be self ordering, or to steer their own course, and perhaps to be sentient. The cybernetic system, having gained that ability, the distinction between machine and humanity is blurred and eventually disappears because in the cybernetic world, victory of method makes it possible for total control over the living and the lifeless world. In the uniformity of the cybernetic world, where the human has been trained, the juggernaut becomes the vehicle.\cbend{} \linelabel{ll370a}

\begin{quotation}
In the technological era, the Will to Will mobilizes humanity to transform the planet into a titanic factory for no other end than to magnify power. The usual ``means-end'' interpretation of instruments, then, makes no sense when applied to the technological era: humanity has become the ``means'' for an end that lies beyond human control or ken. The technological system may be likened to an organic process moving in a circle, but the difference is that there are self-limiting factors in organic cycles that are not discernible in the infinitely expanding spiral of the technological system. Once again calling on Nietzsche, Heidegger asked: ``What is the essence of the modern power-machine other than \emph{one} expression [\emph{Ausformung}] of the eternal return of the same? But the essence of that machine is not anything machine-like or even mechanical.'' [VA I: 118/431] 

\hfill{}\citeA[p.~201]{Zimmerman1990}
\end{quotation}

The inevitable path that the Will to Power must take is the creation of the cybernetic system. A system devoid of humanity, whose aim is the further attribution of power and that can steer itself towards that goal by assimilating information and using that to achieve its aim. But in the cybernetic world, total control over the living and the lifeless world means that even the human gets trained as though it were no more than a dumb machine. In the Hegelian sense, Work provides none of the stuff of life and the human becomes nothing more than a unit in \cbstart{}the\cbend{} vast incorporated machine. \cbdelete{}

In the years before 1933, Heidegger completed his analysis of the productive/disclosive character of the human understanding of being. That reflected his concern about the nature of working and producing, and that concern manifested itself in his analysis of the workshop in \emph{Being and Time}~\cite{Heidegger1972}. At the time, his focus was on the manner of production afforded by the handicraft of the artisan and its comparison with industrialised modes of production. His analysis of equipment and the workshop has three purposes: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item It creates a datum for understanding of human existence as being-in-the-world; 
\item it discloses the importance of the usefulness of the being of entities compared with an objective-scientific understanding; and 
\item it provides foundational arguments that there is a unifying meaning to the being of entities and that the meaning is temporal. 
\end{inparaenum}
Heidegger argues that one must choose a particular entity in order to investigate its mode of being. In his own analysis he selected \emph{Dasein,} the human entity, and applied his version of phenomenology which he defined as the kind of interpretation that allows an entity to disclose itself in the way that is for that entity, the truth. 

\linelabel{ll387}\cbstart{}Visions of the dismemberment of humanity from Work manifest in the mind of the person as doubts about who or what it is that steers the human to its future.{}\footnote{\textls[-8]{\citeA{Junger2007} describes a variation of the Overman~\cite{Nietzsche1987} as an organic construction combining the passion of humanity with technological precision, where hot flesh and cold steel meet. The Overman is portrayed as the cybernetic future, it is rational but lacks those frail human properties that led the West to its current nihilistic state. His vision is portrayed eloquently in movies such as \emph{Metropolis}~(Lang, Pommer, \& Harbou, 1926/1984)\nocite{Lang1926} and \emph{The Terminator}~(Cameron \& Hurd, 1984)\nocite{Cameron1984}.}} On the one hand, the person fears a loss of control over their being but on the other, satisfies the craving in the person to be led to a place of certainty and safety. The modern human lives on the knife's edge of surety that the civilisation it has created for itself will provide for life's exigencies, that the civilised life ensures the person will be protected: morally, ethically, emotionally, and psychologically.\cbend{} The trade-off for the person is that they must pay their dues by presenting themselves to the juggernaut and submitting to its demands. To do so is an agreement and a choice that the person makes, willingly. To choose to submit then, does not remove from the mind of the person the tendency to reach beyond the barriers of what exists, into what is possible.\linelabel{ll387a}

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}
\nobreak
In chapter \ref{chap:litrev}, the argument has been presented such that efforts to control what can be done with systems at times produce contrary or unexpected results. To control and to steer the person\footnote{And to create the cybernetic human.} have been part of the human psyche for millennia, but those attempts have inevitably been thwarted because it is not in the core nature of the human to be thus, controlled. People experiment and expand on what is possible as technologies enable \cbstart{}the development of more sophisticated applications,\cbend{} and people want to do this in their Work. The assumption has been that the meaning of Work in Work Systems is \emph{a priori}. That the Work System is a notion that can be bent to whatever purpose required, resulting in various and contradictory uses of the term, which gives rise to the question: What are the semantics of Work? Therefore; \emph{What are the semantics of Work in the Work System?}

In chapter \ref{chap:method}, it is argued that since the earliest recorded times Work has defined the person and their status defined the Work they undertook. There occurred changes in society, for example from the period of the Renaissance and Enlightenment to the Industrial Revolution, during which social structures were challenged. \cbstart{}While\cbend{} at the same time, advances in technology permitted redefinitions of Work as industries were created and populations were displaced. 

\textls[12]{It is further argued that subsequent changes in technology sped the rate of change in society and therefore Work. For \IS{} the rate of change has been such that technology has evolved faster than the effects of change have been understood. Therefore the argument that \IS{} is in need of a core basis on which theory may be built is made. To create a hard core of theory requires that attention be focussed on where the presentation of knowledge can be described as\cbdelete{} formalism. Thus, a method for the formal definition of Work and the Work System that takes into account both spatial and temporal considerations are described.}
