\section{Introduction}
\nobreak
In chapter \ref{chap:production} it was stated that from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries, productionism tore at the social fabric of communities. Whereas the life and Work of the artisan had been intertwined, productionism forced a gulf between the Work life and home or social life of the person where the home was a place from which to escape the horrors of production and industry. A human response to fill the apparent void created  was to establish labour unions. This provided a relief to autocratic management, and the loss of power the person had over their own destiny by providing a social, democratic environment in which the worker could at least have some influence over their working conditions. More recently, Web 2.0 provides the facility to introduce into the workplace, additional democratic freedoms of deliberation and decision making power through the establishment of a social fabric based on the sense of community through the sharing of information, and the provision of an open environment in which discussion and debate are favoured.

In chapter \ref{chap:democrat} the essence of the technological system is described as an `enframing.' That is to say, to `frame' is a challenge to the technological human to come forward and reveal the actual, where the actual are the data that are accumulated as a standing reserve and ordered in accordance with how the system is revealed. `Framing' is the manner in which to `reveal' governs in the technological system, however `framing' is not itself technological. The technological parts of the system are not of the `enframing,' rather they respond to the challenge of it. The technological parts, while responding, never comprise a part of the `enframing.' Web 2.0 `enframes' participative democratic processes, while the tools facilitate discussion and deliberation. And so in \S\ref{sec:democrat:conclusion}, I said\dots{}

\begin{quotation}
\noindent{}Work, as the engagement of the human in coming forth and ordering the actual in concert with the technological system, sees the human processing the essence of the system as enframing. The technological human's engagement with the essence of the technological system conjoins their purpose and becomes one of participation in which the technological system operates as proxy to human intent. The human participant, who can only respond to what is addressed to it (carried forward through the concept of the Idea), requires that the technological system perform the role of ordering the standing reserve and framing the actual. \hfill(from p.~\pageref{text:Workastheengagement})
\end{quotation}

\textls[8]{In chapter \ref{chap:socialisation}, the technological human is enframed through socialisation in which the ordering of the standing reserve involves the common sharing of information. In \S\ref{sec:socialisation:objective} is presented on objective definition of Work, then in \S\ref{sec:socialisation:worker} Work is framed as a building of relationships through common webs of understanding and knowledge, and that through participation in the democratic processes of deliberation and agreement and involvement in decision making. In \S\ref{sec:socialisation:socialisation}, the mix and match of socialised computing applications and work practices provides the opportunity for the technological human to make alteration in its attitude towards Work (discussed in \S\ref{sec:socialisation:attitude}) in which there is greater awareness of social aspects in the workplace and the manner in which decisions or actions impact on others and away from unitary productionism. Previous decades of industrial processes have created a perception of dislocation from those activities the person was obliged to engage in but the capability of the technological system to provide the ordering of the actual, frees the human from the drudgery of the machine operator. }

The alteration in attitude towards Work, described in \S\ref{sec:socialisation:attitude}, is not so much\cbstart{}about\cbend{} what people do, but\cbdelete{} how and why they do it.\cbdelete{} The technological system reframes the technological human from what was a mere operator at the human-machine interface and allows them to participate in the ordering of the standing reserve. The challenge for the technological human is revealed when the evolution of information systems places the responsibility for personal change upon the human themselves, in preparation to meet the challenges of new technologies as they are revealed. New Ideas provide new opportunities, but these can only be taken up if the technological human has the capacity to participate and be open to the possibilities they offer.

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:notion} Work is described as purposeful directed action and has properties of rationality and purpose. In chapter \ref{chap:production}, it is argued that the worker is bound to the spatiotemporal conditions of the industrial plant. In chapter \ref{chap:socialisation}, I argue that Work effects change, thus Work is spatiotemporally dependent.\footnote{\pageref{socll46}:\ref{socll46}--\pageref{socll46a}:\ref{socll46a}.} Further, I argue that the application of Work means that the object of Work obtains of inertia. Therefore, qualities applied during Work are transferred to the object while Work is undertaken. Further, humanity is defined spatiotemporally. Therefore, whatever is experienced or learned can only be done through spatiotemporal contexts.\footnote{\pageref{socll70b}:\ref{socll70b}--\pageref{socll70c}:\ref{socll70c}. \pageref{socll74}:\ref{socll74}--\pageref{socll74a}:\ref{socll74a}. \pageref{socll77}:\ref{socll77}--\pageref{socll77a}:\ref{socll77a}.} }

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:intro}, I argue that the human is a social being and has the property of mind. In chapter \ref{chap:socialisation}, I add that socialisation provides mechanisms for the satisfaction of needs and urges that either cannot be met on its own, or may be difficult to achieve individually.\footnote{\pageref{socll70}:\ref{socll70}--\pageref{socll70a}:\ref{socll70a}. \pageref{socll98}:\ref{socll98}--\pageref{socll98a}:\ref{socll98a}. } Furthermore, in chapter \ref{chap:socialisation}, the formation of the mind of the person is influenced through processes that are internal and external, and the mental arrangement of the person reflects that of their social group. Thus, through the mechanism of socialisation the person is accepted into a group\footnote{\pageref{socll80}:\ref{socll80}--\pageref{socll80a}:\ref{socll80a}. } where acceptance requires a degree of participation by the person. The Work undertaken by all people in their social group, as duty, becomes a means for mutual support.\footnote{\pageref{socll84}:\ref{socll84}--\pageref{socll84a}:\ref{socll84a}. }}

\ColourTextRed{While chapter \ref{chap:production} drew a distinction between the Greek conception of disclosure and the industrialised process of production, in chapter \ref{chap:socialisation}, the focus is brought back to the Greek conception, where the application of Work is spatiotemporally dependent.\footnote{\pageref{socll26}:\ref{socll26}--\pageref{socll26a}:\ref{socll26a}. } In chapter \ref{chap:socialisation}, the first new argument has two strands: that which is produced out of Work is used as a measure of quality and Work is differentiated from the worker.\footnote{\pageref{socll29}:\ref{socll29}--\pageref{socll29a}:\ref{socll29a}.} In the former strand, the qualities of the worker may be observed through their Work and qualities inherent in Work have an affect on those of the worker.\footnote{\pageref{socll31}:\ref{socll31}--\pageref{socll31a}:\ref{socll31a}.} In the latter, qualities of Work are differentiated from those of the worker.  } 

\ColourTextRed{\textls[12]{In the first strand, the product of Work is regarded from a purely materialist and therefore rationalist position. For example, the communist ideologies of Hegel and Marx are a rationalist conception of humanity and are productionist. However, it is immaterial whether Work is provided in the name of capitalism or communism when both have as their central focus, the technological system.\footnote{\pageref{socll54}:\ref{socll54}--\pageref{socll54a}:\ref{socll54a}. \pageref{socll34}:\ref{socll34}--\pageref{socll34a}:\ref{socll34a}. \pageref{socll37}:\ref{socll37}--\pageref{socll37a}:\ref{socll37a}.} I argue that the enterprise is part of the technological system and consistently fails to appreciate that its workforce is comprised of humans, engaged in their Work.\footnote{\pageref{socll121}:\ref{socll121}--\pageref{socll121a}:\ref{socll121a}. } That failure to appreciate the drive and needs of the person also creates conditions for the enterprise to assume that it must provide for the person an artificial social environment that must be coordinated and controlled. Additionally, that failure is expressed as mistrust and fear of the workers.\footnote{\pageref{socll121b}:\ref{socll121b}--\pageref{socll121c}:\ref{socll121c}.} Fear, mistrust, doubt mark the internal weakness of the productionist technological system.\footnote{\pageref{socll121d}:\ref{socll121d}--\pageref{socll121e}:\ref{socll121e}. }} }

\ColourTextRed{Therefore, in the first strand, I argue that technological humanity has responded to the imposition of fear and doubt in various ways during the last two centuries. Some expressions have been as labour unions and collectives, some have been civil unrest and revolution. Modern communication technologies facilitate a different kind approach, in which humanity may finally be able to take control of the technological system, bending it to the will of the human. The direct approach, that of revolution, has been shown to achieve nothing but to change the masters in the system. Instead, a new attitude is required.\footnote{\pageref{socll127}:\ref{socll127}--\pageref{socll127a}:\ref{socll127a}. } The call to the technological human to regain its lost sense of self is expressed the urge to reassert its individuality as a social being, but to do so, the person must participate in the reformation of the technological system.\footnote{\pageref{socll140}:\ref{socll140}--\pageref{socll140a}:\ref{socll140a}. }}

\ColourTextRed{In the second strand, Work extends beyond materialism where productionist conceptions of Work mask alternatives as being uncompetitive or anti-productive.\footnote{\pageref{socll40}:\ref{socll40}--\pageref{socll40a}:\ref{socll40a}.} Non-materialist notions of Work, such as the argument for the application of democratic processes presented in chapter \ref{chap:democrat}, become a vehicle for the expression of non-productionist human values. This provides a means through Work, for the human to reassert its beingness into its daily affairs.\footnote{\pageref{socll44}:\ref{socll44}--\pageref{socll44a}:\ref{socll44a}.} For the technological human, the path to mastery is not clear and straight. There will be conflicts and seemingly irrational disagreements, and these are natural. It is important that there are mechanisms in place to facilitate the resolution of discord.\footnote{\pageref{socll118b}:\ref{socll118b}--\pageref{socll118c}:\ref{socll118c}. }}

\section{Objective Work} \label{sec:socialisation:objective}
\nobreak
\textls[12]{Through Work, the act of doing is implied. The ancient Greeks differentiated between the person and what they did, from what it was that caused them to do what they did \cbstart{}\cite{Dewey1938}.\cbend{} \linelabel{socll26}\emph{Ergon} (\begin{greek}>'ergon\end{greek}),\cbdelete{} `work' or `labour' is from the action of doing or the verb \emph{erd\'{o}}. \emph{Ergon} is the effort required to reveal or disclose and thus to produce, and it is the product that is disclosed or revealed by the effort. That is to say, a person can `work' to produce, or they can produce `works.' Unlike revealing or disclosure, the meaning of \emph{ergon} is based on the context of its use and so it can be a `deed,' the act of `doing,' a quantity of `labour,' or it is `work'~\cite{Biblos2010}. Work, \emph{ergon,} is distinct from its cause and results, it is not a metaphysical notion or Idea but the physical or material action and process that itself causes some change. In the Bible it says: ``And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.'' (Rom. 11:6). \linelabel{socll26a}}

\linelabel{socll29}As a means of producing, Work finds its justification in what \cbdelete{}has been produced. \cbstart{}Thus, the manner of Work provides justification for the veracity of the means. Therefore,\cbend{} if faults are found in the product then the suggestion is that the tasks or action of Work needs to be improved to prevent such faults. If the Work of producing consumes too many resources for the amount that are produced then, again, careful analysis of the Work that has been done needs to show where improvements can be made. Howsoever Work finds its justification does not give any kind of measure as to the qualities that might be found in Work or the worker. \linelabel{socll29a}

\linelabel{socll31}Those qualities that exist in the worker can be observed through their Work, for example the worker that displays enthusiasm through qualities inherent in what and how they work. The work required of them has a bearing where drudgery is not likely to engender enthusiasm and so an observer may expect that the quality of what is produced will reflect that. Perhaps that is why \cbstart{}we mock the `chicken factory farm' styled call centre,\cbend{} where quality is enforced through scripted questions and responses. However, defining specific processes provides a positive benefit where the workings of policy disclose those things that might otherwise be in contravention. \linelabel{socll31a}

\linelabel{socll34}Synonymous with the creation of strategy, principles and rules of governance: policy defines a \cbstart{}possible\cbend{} course of action. Policies affect the operational level of Work by providing rules that workers adhere to when decisions are made. Policies are often adopted for the sake of expediency or are arrived at through the experience of exigency. While policies define rules or a course of action for a given action, they are disclosive when they are contravened. Thus, for example, if through performing their prescribed Work, a worker is found to be in error when dealing with another person from outside the enterprise, then a change to policy is required. Unlike Work, which is validated by its results, policies are never validated, they can only be invalidated when they have been contravened and found to be in error. Policies are non-material ideologies relying on the physicality of Work for their acceptance and approval.\linelabel{socll34a}

\linelabel{socll37}In a command and control management structure, instructions for a worker are passed down the chain of command. In variance with policy, instructions fed through to the intermediary of the supervisor to provide commands on what must be done, while the policy wording states what must be done, with, how and why they must be done. Thus \emph{ergon}, Work, is materialist and quantifiable. Work can be assayed through tests being applied to the product of Work, thus it is both validated and justified through external tests.\linelabel{socll37a}

\linelabel{socll40}Beyond the materialist conception of Work, it is through their Work that a person can learn much more than just the process of how to complete a task. For example, the quality of the person shows through their Work: integrity, seriousness, \cbstart{}and\cbend{} incorruptibility. These attributes, hard to perceive in oneself from simple observation of oneself, become remarkable when perceived through the application of Work and the product of their disclosure. From there, labels that describe the qualities inherent in the product can be attributed to the producer. The person of quality is justified through their Work and not only through the power of faith, but the faith they have in themselves or some entity that they may use to justify themselves or their actions to self or others. While the quality of the person shows through in their Work, this is not to say that the person and their Work are \cbdelete{}the same. However, the person imbues their Work with the qualities they hold, so that if they should cease or withhold those attributes, then what is revealed in their Work will seem similarly empty. Thus, Truth is revealed through Work. Productionist metaphysics provides no difference between that which is manufactured in the industrial process and that which is produced by the artisan, except that the standardised state of the productionist manufacturing process is able to create consistent duplicates of objects where the artisan is variable in their state and so too, is what they produce. All that is produced by the enterprise under productionism is therefore stripped of the essence of the artisan where even the mask of humanity created by public relations announcements are devoid of the spark of spirited disclosure.\linelabel{socll40a}

\linelabel{socll44}Work is not democratic but it can facilitate the democratic process where the machinery required is present. Just as there is no right to democracy for the human to exist, although it may be considered so that the human has the right to choose their own destiny and to have the power to make such decisions as to who or how they might be governed, so it is that Work is not a right. Instead, Work is a natural condition of being human; Work is an expression of the beingness of humanity in its urge to do, to act, to disclose, and to reveal the truth that is hidden.\linelabel{socll44a}

\linelabel{socll46}Therefore, \cbstart{}for any kind of change to be exercised in the workplace, it stands that Work must be\cbend{} spatiotemporally dependent. That is, unless Work is applied, then nothing can change. All that is material obtains of some degree to inertia\label{text:socialisation:inertia} and Work, the effort exerted, seeks to overcome that inertia. It is the transference of intent, quality, purpose, emotion, and will from the worker to effect change. Emotional attachments are formed from the effort consumed when objects are produced. Work starts and ends. It does not exist in the passive or in the state of\linelabel{socll46a} rest.\footnote{\citeA{Mortensen2006} says that in modern science, it is a physical law that force must be applied to cause a body to be moved or put into motion and so any change must have a cause. Uncaused change might exist conceptually but not practically, so it might be said that the absence of an apparent cause suggests that the cause has not yet been found. Conversely, a sustaining cause will result in no change if the thing undergoing change is sustaining a preventive cause (its negation) in the same moment the sustaining cause is applied. The application of cause that puts an object in motion also provides for recording of that motion during an interval of time. The concept of change is discussed in \S\ref{sec:evolution:change}.}

\section{The worker is reframed} \label{sec:socialisation:worker}
\nobreak
\textls[8]{In \S\ref{sec:socialisation:worker}, I discuss how the technological system has reframed the worker into the technological human through the eyes of two commentators, \cbstart{}\citeA{Masaryk1971} and \citeA{Tannenbaum1952},\cbend{} whose views vary through time, space, and political tidal forces. \linelabel{socll51}\cbdelete{}Workers were drawn \cbstart{}away\cbend{} from their rural domiciles to urban centres, to find the means for earning a money wage.\linelabel{socll51a} \cbdelete{}\citeauthor{Masaryk1971} and \citeauthor{Tannenbaum1952} discuss the relationship of the worker and master/employer/boss. For \citeauthor{Masaryk1971}, the tensions are drawn between socialism and religion whereas for \citeauthor{Tannenbaum1952} it is between naturally formed social groups and imposed social orders that are generally the result of economic and political exigencies. }

\citeA{Masaryk1971} says the first principle of Social Democracy of \citeA{Marx1998}, which was derived from the work of Hegel, has as its basis, the idea that both the individual, national groups, and even the whole of humanity when taken together are God. \linelabel{socll54}This sounds out of place since historical or economic materialism is atheist but, while \cbstart{}humanity\cbend{} should not be deified, \cbdelete{}the proletariat \cbdelete{}is God. The second principle is that `Man is what he eats,' thus where mind is a product of the body, then mind is a product of what is eaten. Since what is eaten is secured by Work, then the mind is the result of Work and of production generally. Therefore, humanity is what it makes. \citeauthor{Marx1998} take this argument to its logical conclusion when they contend that the conditions of production become the real foundations of all social life. For them, all history and development is reduced to the issue of how to secure food and what to procure for the satisfaction of bodily needs. All else (philosophy, art, religion, the state, ethics, and morals) are ideology and utopian with no actual significance. This is at the essential core of productionist metaphysics and is the kind of socialism that is anti-individualistic. It is where the opinion and conscience of the mass of the proletariat is what is important and hence the reference to it being God. \linelabel{socll54a}

If the anti-individualistic socialism of \citeauthor{Marx1998} establishes one end of the materialist world, then Stirner's~\citeyear{Stirner1845} egoist individualism reaches to the other end. \citeauthor{Stirner1845} opposes socialism of any kind, whereas the Marxist doctrine of socialism denies the individual in favour of the proletariat. For \citeauthor{Stirner1845}, individualism defines humanity \cbstart{}as\cbend{} the individual: \cbstart{}humanity\cbend{} becomes a specific `ego.' In an effort to displace hierarchies, the individual is not concerned about anyone or anything in favour of itself. The `ego' is the super-truth and if it seems right to the `ego,' then it is right~\cite{Masaryk1971}. However, as with Marx and Engels' socialism, Stirner's individualism seeks to emancipate the individual from their subjection to phantoms (the comparison does not end there because both stem from the work of Hegel). For \citeauthor{Stirner1845}, all general concepts, all religious and political ideals, and all Ideas are phantoms. In particular, the State itself is \cbdelete{}violence towards the individual where the goal is to have power, and power is the truth. The individual who can acquire and exercise power is perfect. Thus Individualism is the essential anarchism, absent of State sponsored government. \citeA{Tannenbaum1952} rejects the idea that nihilist individualism is a natural condition for a person or group of people. \linelabel{socll57}The industrial juggernaut\footnote{See the comment in footnote \ref{text:litrev:juggernaut} on p. \pageref{text:litrev:juggernaut}.} served to destroy most pre-industrial social links, and so workers, disenfranchised, formed their own social units based on their occupational employment. \citeauthor{Tannenbaum1952} also objects to the views of \citeauthor{Marx1998}. \linelabel{socll57a}

For \citeA{Tannenbaum1952} the great moral tragedy of the industrial system was that it ``destroyed the symbolic and meaningful world that had endowed the life of the individual with an ethical character''~\citeyear[p.~8]{Tannenbaum1952}. Those who were first exposed to the industrial revolution came from a world in which people lived in mutually supporting clusters. Theirs was not a money- or wage-based existence, but one in which functions were fulfilled by skilled artisans and succession was often generational. In the productionist industrial and technological system, the individual worker has been stripped of their `natural' place, any society they could naturally call their own, and those values that  were attached to their society, values they were expected to live by. ``The ordinary meanings that make life acceptable had evaporated. His economic insecurity was but part of a larger perplexity''~\citeyear[p.~8]{Tannenbaum1952}. A new social order was being created with the rapid growth of industrial centres. For \citeauthor{Tannenbaum1952} the solution to the problem of the dislocation of the individual from their `natural' place was through the establishment of trade unions. He admits that trade unions have become subject to socialist, political, and economic forces, but still sees that they offer a place of refuge for the individual. It is in the collective of the trade union that social ties could be wrought and some semblance of the community that had been lost, regathered. The collective provided the worker with a platform for the establishment of social norms, mores, ethics, and values. While they were largely egalitarian in the context of the workplace, there was, through politicisation, the formation of power structures.

\linelabel{socll62}\label{text:social.revolution}In any sense of the collective, there are classes, and so classes of worker exist. Where classes of worker exist there are tensions that are the result of perceptions of difference. These are not the Marxist tensions of class difference that can only be resolved through revolution. Rather, they are the natural variances that ought to exist in a `naturally formed' society. It is through their existence that growth occurs. Without the perception of difference, there can be no evolution or development because there is no recognition of need. Revolution is a destructive force. Energy is used up in a scrappy tumult, bringing only a return to balance, albeit at a different place to where the revolution started. Revolution, ultimately, is a political means to a political end.\linelabel{socll62a}

Modern technology is a means to an end says \citeA{Heidegger1954}, so that everything depends on society's facility to manipulate technology to ensure its ends meet those of the technological human. \linelabel{socll65}The essence of the technological system is to enframe, \cbstart{}within which\cbend{} the human \cbdelete{}must master the ordering of the standing reserve. Thus, modern technology in the form of Web 2.0 challenges the human through its power of ordering, to reveal the standing reserve as information \cbstart{}that\cbend{} can be used in the democratic process of deliberation and decision making. Democracy in the technological system is more than just a game of political power brokerage, for it becomes a means by which the standing reserve is ordered.\linelabel{socll65a} Stirner's~\citeyear{Stirner1845} insistence then, that it is nihilist power that enframes the individual, is out of place in the technological system. \linelabel{socll65b}It may be said, that power is truth, but the power of truth is born out of the power to order the standing reserve, and in the context of Web 2.0 that means power lies with those who are best able to order data which has been stored for these then become the standing reserve. Power then, is exercised in the crowd, by the crowd, where the lone voice of the nihilist is largely lost.\linelabel{socll65c}

According to \citeA{Masaryk1971}, the problem that the science and profession of politics must solve is to comprehend the relation of the individual to society, the problem of individualism versus collectivism, and the explanation of how the individual becomes a social being. That is, how the individual person ought to behave towards society and how they affect the rights and spheres of activity of other individuals. What then are the attributes that make a person a social being? What are their individual and collective duties?

\linelabel{socll70}A person does not exist \cbstart{}alone,\cbend{} they need to survive and they have urges for belonging that must be met.\linelabel{socll70a} That means they are more than mere members of a socio-cultural group they are more than just an individual within the group~\cite{Gripaldo2003}.\footnote{\citeA{White2002} refers to the artefacts that make up culture as religion, philosophy, science, technology, art, education, politics, and government. He argues that culture is itself a by-product of the beingness of humanity. He says in the cultural context, and in reference to Peirce, metaphysics are an important component of the cultural landscape and a philosophy of anything is bereft without it.} \linelabel{socll70b}For \cbstart{}its\cbend{} existence to be validated and confirmed, the person must co-operate with other members in their group, to make this person a social being. \cbstart{}In addition,\cbend{} the person is a historical being, meaning that over time as they grow toward maturity they have interacted with others in their socio-cultural group, from family to acquaintances. Thus, theirs is a spatiotemporal existence in which learning skills and abilities, develop awareness and sensitivities, and to create or adopt behaviours takes time and experience.\linelabel{socll70c}

As a person grows from the time of their birth they learn about the world, \cbstart{}into which they have been thrown\cbend{} \cite{Heidegger1972}. \linelabel{socll74}To begin, \cbstart{}the person\cbend{} simply absorbs experiences and begins to fashion those into a synaptic web of understanding. Experiences cause internal reactions within the person such as: emotional responses like joy, sorrow, anger, and happiness; intellectual responses like understanding, appreciation, certainty, confusion, and doubt; and physical responses like pleasure, pain, arousal, agitation, and relaxation. From what they experience, the person can attach the stimulus that gave rise to their internal responses. At times, the stimulus is clear and directed, such as a set of instructions or commands, or the delivery of rules of conduct. Other times they may be more diffuse and produce confused or confusing responses, such as when a person tries to interpret the actions of another person but find they can only do so from the framework of understandings they already possess. While still a child, the person is guided by their peers and elders but as they begin to mature more questions arise regarding what it is that they deal with externally and what is happening to themselves internally in response to stimuli, and over time the child begins to develop a sense of their individual consciousness. \linelabel{socll74a}

\newpage{}\linelabel{socll77}To explain individual consciousness, one must seek to understand what is the individual's and what is derived from its race, \cbstart{}culture, social environment, and its species. Only then is consideration granted to consideration of the person's part in a socio-cultural group and the psycho-social impact of that.\cbend{} Although \citeA{Marx1998} say that consciousness is not individual and is thus collective and therefore the individual does not exist, Descarte's \emph{cogito ergo sum}, while not evidence that the individual person as a material substance exists, does provide evidence of the mind of the individual. The person grows from birth and gains knowledge from their experiences and responses to stimuli. Their consciousness of self is revealed as they grow from infant to child, then through puberty to adulthood. They learn to differentiate between what is internal and external to \cbstart{}them.\cbend{}\linelabel{socll77a} A thinking person that exists and has the capacity to think therefore has the ability to recognise that \cbdelete{}they\cbdelete{} are thinking and therefore they exist~\cite{Kierkegaard1985}.

\linelabel{socll80}The culture of which the person is a part is a blend of influences that have arisen from the combined and compounded internal responses of the individual participants and external influences. \cbstart{}For example,\cbend{} natural phenomena like climate, availability of food and water, terrain, and aspect, and other socio-cultural groups who exercise some degree of influence whether through trade and agreement, aggression, cultural similarities and differences, religion, and politics. Often socio-cultural groups are identified as civil societies. These take the form of social groups that form around some degree of agreement in which there is mutual strengthening or weakening of character, or they are genealogical and the person gains admittance through their birth-right. Most groups are managed or controlled through some degree of political coercion.\linelabel{socll80a}

\linelabel{socll84}What then are a person's individual and collective duties? These can be considered as ethical and moral imperatives. Duty is a social force that binds a person to some course of action, such as their Work. For example, a person may have the duty to perform their Work to satisfy moral or legal obligations. A worker is obliged to fulfil a role of Work and through this, their social and moral obligations\label{text:socialisation:social} to their socio-cultural group, to the extent that they satisfy their needs to survive and urges to belong. As a social being that co-operates with others in the socio-cultural group, the rest of the group relies on the efforts of the individual to perform their duties for the survival of the group. In the socio-cultural group, the worker is seen as more than just an economic unit or human resource to be exploited. In the fulfilment of their individual and collective duties, the Work done by the worker becomes a means of mutual support.\footnote{See page \pageref{text:production:support}.}\cbdelete{} Traditional roles and activities can be duties where successes of the past have led to an expectation that those roles and activities will be repeated. Historical events may be traditional but they may not have led to successes that members of the group want repeated. Some events may be seen to have been effected as the result of some external power or entity and cannot be repeated.\linelabel{socll84a}

\linelabel{socll86}The ancient Greeks had the belief that political happenings and historical events were the direct result of the interference of the pantheon of gods \cbstart{}\cite{Larousse1987}.\cbend{} Every action, while performed by the individual, is a manifestation of the whole, which in turn, is a manifestation of the divine. This view prevails in the apparent genius of the poet and artist who makes the claim that their art cannot be contrived but that it is formed from musings that are revealed through inspiration. The prophet is seen as an entirely different kind of human to the ordinary mortal and even politicians and heroes may be seen as heaven-sent. \linelabel{socll86a}

\textls[4]{\linelabel{socll89}\cbstart{}The ideas of\cbend{} those who are perceived to be more than merely an individual in a socio-cultural group may be seen to have more impact and carry greater weight of importance than decisions that are made by those who are in the mass of individuals that comprise the body of the group. Democracy provides a means by which the greater mass can choose who they want to make decisions on their behalf. Often those who are chosen are elected \cbstart{}based on\cbend{} of perceived merit or fame. The classical view of democracy described by \citeA{Pateman1970} sees a political method for choosing leaders or as a set of institutional arrangements at local or national level, where through competition, votes at periodic elections are counted to choose an \'{e}lite. The person's participation in this process serves to protect both them and the \'{e}lite who won the race to gain sufficient votes. However, as a system its stability is largely only assured if the level of participation does not \cbstart{}raise\cbend{} much above the minimum necessary to keep the machine working. That means the greater mass must elect to give up (through apathy, resignation, abdication of responsibility) the right to make decisions in certain areas of governance, law, economics, and local management of resources, but there are often questions as to where the boundary between the individual's judgement and that of the collective prevail.\linelabel{socll89a}}

\linelabel{socll91}To what extent does judgement reside in the individual and in taught logic and to what extent in the collective? The process of sampling from the scientific method provides the answer, in that the judgement of all cannot be known and so a representative sampling provides an approximation of the collective decision. New law provides an example where the few who were selected create new rules of conduct for the many to follow. Government is by the few for the many, management also. In ethics the question is how far, does one rely on mass distinction to determine what is right? Is it correct to take it on the vote of the majority or from individual conscience? It is from these tensions that the apparent conflict between individual and collective, and anarchism versus socialism emerge.\linelabel{socll91a}

Individualism, says \citeA{Masaryk1971}, is materialist where the essential nature of the `I' or `ego' is the body.\footnote{Russian anarchism, according to \citeA{Masaryk1971}, is what is referred to as nihilism by Turgeniev in \emph{Fathers and Sons}. Dostoievsky shows how the absolute `ego' comes to proclaim itself as God but as such what is there for it to do? The `ego' is weak and inept, it is fragile and cannot create of itself. Dostoievsky's anarchists proclaim that ``all is permissible,'' and Alistair Crowley crows ``Do what thou wilt,'' till there is nothing left for it but to denounce and destroy.  Thus comes revolution and terror, Crowley's beast, and violence, the last recourse of the nihilistic deity in \emph{reductio}.} \linelabel{socll93}\cbstart{}To the nihilist, the\cbend{} measure of all things is through the body and not the mind, ideas, or ideals where these things are merely utopian ideologies. \cbstart{}The sensation of satisfaction is measured as the physicality of pleasure.\cbend{} The greater the bodily sensation of pleasure, the higher the satisfaction level. When the `ego,' as the individual body, is only concerned with itself and what is therefore agreeable to itself and its own pleasures, then it becomes unvarnished nihilism.\linelabel{socll93a}

\linelabel{socll96}Innovation and creativity are squeezed out from the forces that interplay between the individual and collective desires for power and to have influence over each other. Just as necessity is the mother of invention, so it is that conditions that provide for need are found, not in a utopian perfection but in the trials and tribulations of exactitude. Not just in economic or historical materialism but in all spheres of the individual's existence. The individual needs to be recognised for who and what they are, and what they have achieved.\linelabel{socll96a} Without that, there can be ``no formalised society, no accepted drama to act out, and no responsibilities for the individual or for the society to which the individual is functionally and organically related''~\cite[p.~69]{Tannenbaum1952}.

\linelabel{socll98}Web 2.0 as the technological system facilitates the instinct in the `natural' human to bond and group, framed as the use of social and networking tools. The `natural' human is reframed as the technological human. The challenge for the technological human as standing reserve, enframed within Web 2.0, is to resist the ordering of it as a means of creating an artificial social context. Web 2.0 has the appearance of being nihilist but to follow its `natural' instinct, the technological human stands apart from the technological system. The person seeks to satisfy the urge to stand apart by gathering itself to itself in an anarchic nihilism, by aggregating with others in a social milieu. A third option is for the technological human to adopt the persona of agreeable acceptance while privately playing the role of anarch.\label{text:socialisation:anarch} That does not remove the element of the social milieu, but does eliminate nihilism in the individual.\linelabel{socll98a}

\linelabel{socll101}The technological system provides the framework. \cbdelete{}While it is the role of society to serve and protect \cbstart{}the members of a community,\cbend{} Web 2.0 changes the nature of the relationship by redefining what is meant by security and personal ownership. The productionist enterprise seeks to gain traction in Web 2.0 by commandeering the means of ordering and establishing for its own ends, the power of truth. Through its means, the technological human is co-opted through a perception of misplaced trust. The element of trust, the trust that the \cbstart{}person\cbend{} places in \cbdelete{}society as the moral and ethical guide for their beliefs and actions remains, but the constituents of what is morally correct and ethical are based now in commercial and economic exigencies. \cbdelete{}Commercial exigency has been extended to the online community, such that the \cbstart{}person\cbend{} blithely hands over their private information simply because `society,' represented by the technological artefact of a website, requested it. The trust of the \cbstart{}person\cbend{} in the `society' is instinctual. \cbstart{}Would `society'\cbend{} do anything other than \cbdelete{}serve and protect? It is as na\"{i}ve as it seems. \cbdelete{}The \cbstart{}person is a paradox where they are, on the one hand, the standing reserve while at the same time providing the mechanism for emancipation. It must be in the collective response that the technological system is challenged.\cbend{} \linelabel{socll101a}


\section{Socialisation enframed} \label{sec:socialisation:socialisation}
\nobreak
\linelabel{socll106}Comprehension of the relationship between individualism and collectivism and the explanation of how the individual becomes a social being, lies at the core of enframing as socialisation.\linelabel{socll106a} \citeA{Bentham1823} said the community is a fictitious body composed of individuals, and that individuals have their own mores and ethics that may run counter to that prescribed by `society.' \citeauthor{Bentham1823} promoted utilitarianism and for him the presences of tight-knit rural communities were an obstruction that needed to be cleared on the way to a bright industrial future. The breaking down of communities of ill-educated masses produced workers who were easier to control, but it also became a necessity to ensure that those masses remained down at heel. There could be no participation in the management of terms and decision making processes. His view was authoritarian, not democratic. For \citeauthor{Bentham1823}, the establishment of trade unions were a significant threat to the maintenance and distribution of power.\footnote{Utilitarianism is the ethics of utility, of profit. That usefulness as advantage ought to be the goal of every action and is determined by pleasure, well being, and happiness. Thus an aspect of utilitarianism is hedonism, or the ethics of pleasure. The satisfaction of pleasure has an individual response: My own advantage and only my advantage is the object of my efforts. Compared with the collective response: Not merely my own gain, but that of the greatest number of people. \citeauthor{Bentham1823} says that a person strives for their own pleasure to avoid suffering whereas \citeA{Mill1965} says that there are qualities ascribed to pleasures (his was a moral stance). Bentham's person is an `egoist' who seeks for pleasure for himself, alone. \citeauthor{Mill1965} demands self-sacrifice of the individual for the greater good whereas the `ego' may see work as a succession of small an unpleasant tasks. To escape this view, Work is given a romantic edge. Workers become heroes who perform great deeds, they stretch themselves out across the landscape and lay down their lives for the sake of it. Utilitarianism puts the worker to task, completing first what is essential to facilitate life, the daily chores that must be completed~\cite[pp.~52--57]{Masaryk1971}.} 

\linelabel{socll110}Pre-industrial society provided more than a set piece for genealogical reproduction. It was a small scale democracy \cbstart{}where\cbend{} society held to rules of belonging, behaviour, joining, and exclusion that had been built up over time. Individual communities were often culturally as well as socially unique, even with their own dialect and accent. For the worker to have been wrought by this and then torn from it was both dislocating and opening. The worker felt the need to belong because they always had; it is a part of the beingness of the person, their Dasein, their nature. To materialist industrial economics, the beingness of the person is irrelevant, insisting instead that the purpose of the person is nothing more than the provision of labour, with suitable recompense. 

Seemingly stripped of its humanity and socio-cultural group, the nihilistic technological human was set adrift in the technological system. Over time, the technological human has learned that it is either framed by the technological system or that it must gain mastery over the ordering of the standing reserve through socialisation where ordering involves the common sharing of information. That deliberative democracy provides both a sense of freedom and socialisation and where the class hierarchy of the future will be defined by those who are best able to establish power by their mastery over the standing reserve.\linelabel{socll112}

\newpage{}\linelabel{socll114}Modern technology, in this instance Web 2.0, provides the framework through which the technological human is challenged to reveal the standing reserve. \cbstart{}Thus, from has been said before; power is truth and truth is power, and they who are able to reveal knowledge and\cbend{} information as truth gain mastery over the technological system. The Work of the technological human is to reveal truth and to use that to gain power. The building of commonly shared understandings and knowledge, facilitate democratic processes where deliberation becomes the means by which agreement is made on what is to be the truth and decisions are made based on the power of that.\linelabel{socll114a}

\textls[4]{\linelabel{socll118}\cbstart{}As a concept, Web 2.0\cbend{} tools vary according to need and use. Whereas productionist thinking is firmly tied to the idea that maximum production is only possible when repeated processes are put in place, the socialised computing environment permits greater autonomy from the person, and allows them the opportunity to make decisions up to a predefined level. This is seen in the characteristics that \citeA{Oreilly2005} attributes to Web 2.0. That the standing reserve is the driving force, it maintains an architecture of participation, the means of development is participatively democratic through the open source community, content and service syndication provides the means for the educative enrichment of the mass of technological humanity, and the cycles of evolutionary development are never ending. The greater freedom to discuss and decide, offers the opportunity for a shift in attitude away from the dispossessed.\linelabel{socll118a} \linelabel{socll118b}The interplay between workers in their deliberations \cbstart{}is\cbend{} likely to cause periods of friction and possible discord. This in a `natural' human context is normal, just as in pre-industrial societies there were disagreements and conflicts that needed to be resolved for the sake of the long-term survival of the group. It is from such forces that innovations and creative solutions are revealed and the success of these provides the groundwork for greater success.\linelabel{socll118c} \citeA{KaneFichman2009} use this in their argument where they propose the use of wikis that allow editors to make better informed decisions in the journal review process. If reviewers can respond to each other's comments, they say then, the period of open dialogue is a better use of the reviewers' time. They can find agreement if they have to decide whether to accept a submission for publication or make suggestions for improvement.}

\linelabel{socll121}The temptation for the enterprise is to see this as an opportunity to create an artificial social context, and then impose arbitrary rules that limit access, content, and use.\linelabel{socll121a} This was the case at BT (\S\ref{sec:cases:bt}) and IBM (\S\ref{sec:cases:ibm}) where there was a fear that social media might change what people did in their Work or that they would use this as a platform for grandstanding and airing complaints. \linelabel{socll121b}Of course, work practices \cbdelete{}change, but productionist thinking, locked into that which focusses solely on the streamlining of processes and placing no trust in their workers, finds it difficult to conceive that people do not necessarily inherently hate their work just because that was the environment Bentham inculcated.\linelabel{socll121c} Contrary to the `powers'\,' reservations, staff at BT used the social media channels in a positive way and IBM found the social media tools to be very beneficial to the company's long term success. \linelabel{socll121d}Society has shown through the ages that it is quite capable of building itself up to be stable, resilient, trustworthy, moral, and ethical. The `natural' human has a tendency to align itself with these attributes and not to attack and destroy its socio-cultural group, in this case, the enterprise. The apparent tendency toward fear and mistrust that exists in the enterprise is the fruit of productionist metaphysical materialism, (whether it is called capitalist or communist) but Work, reframed, places socialisation of the workplace as the moral and ethical guide for the beliefs and actions of workers.\linelabel{socll121e}

\section{A shift in attitude toward Work} \label{sec:socialisation:attitude}
\nobreak
\linelabel{socll127}\cbstart{}In \S\ref{sec:socialisation:attitude}, I argue that the technological human is reframed by the system. However, technological humanity is called upon to regain its lost sense of self, and this places the technological system under threat. The threat is not one of frontal attack, but rather from technological humanity re-approaching what it means to do Work. There is a shift in attitude in technological humanity that the system cannot address while technological humanity continues to deliver what is required of it.\cbend{} The attitudinal shift is not so much in what people do but in how and why they do it. \cbstart{}For example,\cbend{} new entrants into the workplace take time to find themselves and adjust to the conditions where they work. Complex information systems make this more difficult because most institutional knowledge is held by those who are already there, and so new entrants face a period of anxious learning until they `get it right.'\linelabel{socll127a} \cbstart{}For example, \citeA{McKeller2008} report current attitudes of new entrants to the enterprise, those enter with the expectation that they will have access to real time data, by using various, non-standardised devices.\cbend{}

\linelabel{socll128}\cbdelete{}The technological system reframes \cbstart{}technological humanity and provides allowance for participation\cbend{} in ordering the standing reserve.\cbdelete{} \cbstart{}Under productionism, the destiny of the technological human is determined by the demigods of industry. The demigods' state what the person must do, how it must behave, to what it can or cannot respond. Even as the appearance of the technological human, the person has managed to retain those properties that make the person unique.\cbend{} The technological human is part of nature despite the fact that the economic juggernaut has wrenched its soul. For the technological human to come to know itself as participant in the system means the \cbdelete{}person has come to be intelligent about, and understand the technological system. Then, when turned to human purposes, the technological system becomes an object of knowledge and the technological human becomes the standing reserve. \linelabel{socll128a}

\linelabel{}The technological system \cbstart{}is\cbend{} rational, and as standing reserve, the technological human comes to know the effect of changes that have been wrought upon \cbstart{}it\cbend{} and to know intimately its relationship with the technological system. \linelabel{socll133}As changes are made to the technological system, so those changes are reflected in the standing reserve, which now includes the technological human and all that existed previously. Whereas innovation was perceived to be the result of the interference of the gods or the product of divine inspiration, now it is the ordering of the standing reserve and comes under the control of the technological human\linelabel{socll133a} as is shown in the case of IBM where there is a culture that is focussed on innovation instead of production. As a result, social networking has become integral to the core business strategy at IBM, where participative democratic processes of deliberation and collaboration are a primary focus.

New graduates are entering the workforce with the expectation that they are able to utilise tools and applications they have become accustomed to using throughout their lives \cbstart{}\cite{McKeller2008}.\cbend{} The general view is that mobile technologies are pervasive and becoming increasingly ubiquitous \cite{BenMokhtar2008}. While these are merely changes at a societal or cultural level, they are reflective of how the technological human is preparing \cbstart{}it\cbend{} to become an equal participant in the technological system. Does that mean the \cbstart{}technological system is close\cbend{} its cybernetic goal? \cbdelete{}Whether the technological human is cybernetic, that much is far from being realised since that part of the human that is core, essential, at its spirit, remains human.\cbdelete{}

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:socialisation:conclusion}
\nobreak
\citeA{Dewey1938} said change in the human occurs only at the cultural or societal level. The examples discussed show this to be case, where the technological human craves \cbdelete{}social connection and is not content to merely be a cog in the industrial plant, bent on production. \linelabel{socll140}The challenge for the technological human is how to prepare to meet the challenge of new technologies as they are revealed. What is revealed provides new opportunities, but the technological human must have the capacity to participate and be open to the possibilities offered.\linelabel{socll140a}

\linelabel{socll143}Productionism is an attempt to limit change as the basis for creating stability, uniformity, and therefore conformity. It requires only that workers opt not to conform that the system begins to collapse. Processes are normally designed in such a way that they optimise the use of resources, but the downside of this is \cbstart{}when\cbend{} the system is left vulnerable to unanticipated changes to the internal and external environment. When these changes are wrought by people frustrated by their unexpressed desire to gain mastery over the system and their immediate environment, then the risk of destabilisation becomes paramount. The refusal of workers to conform to the dictates of the technological system results in an unstable work environment. \cbstart{}The threat of this is at the root the fear and mistrust the enterprise regards its employees. This is not to say these are typically the intentions of the worker, or that any evidence of this should exist.\cbend{}\linelabel{socll143a}

\linelabel{socll146}Democratic processes are fundamental to the success of Web 2.0. They translate in the enterprise as improvements for the participative process of the person where their effort is recognised and encouraged, so that they see that their concerns are valid, recognised, valued, and appreciated. Conflict and disagreement are a natural part of socialisation. Such activities are not be feared, and where technology provides the means through which opposing views can be resolved, not as a mediator but by providing suitable channels through which data are able to inform, then both the enterprise and the person benefit. However, the person, individually and collectively, provides moral and ethical direction through mediation, not the enterprise. The process does not mean any group or individual must lose their identity, but instead, participation provides opportunity for improvement and to create new frames within the technological system.\linelabel{socll146a}

\textls[4]{In chapter \ref{chap:evolution}, it is argued that the technological human adapts to the changing socio-cultural environment while at the same time, \cbstart{}the technological human is an agency of change and affects\cbend{} the enterprise. \cbstart{}As a participant and an agency of change, the technological human fulfills the role of worker, through Work.\cbend{} However, the association presents a highly dynamic environment and managerial contrivances to ensure business outcomes create conditions for the technological human to adapt in new and innovative ways.}
