\section{Introduction}
\nobreak
\citeA{Anderson1964} and \citeA{Masaryk1971} say that it is the manner in which the members of the working collective apply themselves in Work that sets the tone for how they live their lives, and this discloses their lives to themselves. Society learns about itself by seeing how it is that the members of society work and this brings into question the ends that workers work to achieve. Work is such a core component of the lives of all of society's members that any individual may be forgiven for not questioning its presence, however \linelabel{notionll5}I suggest that for as long as the human has been capable of rational thought, they have directed that thought and associated action towards expressions of social status, aspirations, desires, and goals. Since that time when the human emerged from its cave of darkened ignorance, the notion of Work has resided as an urge in humanity to fulfil its perceived potential through acts. The notion of Work, therefore, is that it is purposeful directed action.

In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, the notion of Work is presented as purposeful directed action and is a property of the natural being of the person. \cbstart{}The factors and reasons that define Work vary.\linelabel{notionll7} In\cbend{} \S\ref{sec:notion:whatWorkMeans}, Work is the effort required to transform things in a natural or raw state into things that we want or desire. These then have a tradable value but as a role, \citeA{Tannenbaum1952} says, Work has social and moral values too.  The argument is presented that Work is a means of support for economic gain, a sense of fulfilment, the facilitation of life, and the legitimisation of religious doctrine or some other utopian ideal. It is part of the worker's being, naturally so, intertwining them in the industry of which they are a part. In \S\ref{sec:notion:Reason}, I argue that when the person is reduced to an economic unit or human resource to be exploited, \cbstart{}and\cbend{} then the person is separated from the beingness of their creative itself. Further, I argue that the separation of the natural state of the person from its abstracted form, the symbolic worker, prevents engagement in which the person \cbstart{}finds their true expression\cbend{}. The objectification of the person of the worker provides the conditions for exploitation through the application of the principles of Scientific Management.

The notion of action is presented in \S\ref{sec:notion:action}. The discussion starts by distinguishing between the person and their act, and that action is the embodiment of the person's intention to produce, but the actions of the person are roles that they play. Thus, \cbstart{}that which is produced because\cbend{} of the action of a person who is fulfilling their role is regarded as a cultural artefact. Information systems are regarded in this context as cultural artefacts with the added dimension that they also emulate the human act. It is argued then, that information systems are designed to assist in the resolution of human problems and they do so by emulating aspects of the human act. However, the issues raised in this section\cbdelete{} result in questions about whether information systems that are designed to assist the person to resolve problems might also effect changes in the nature of the person too.

\cbstart{}\citeA{Dewey1938}\cbend{} offers a means to answer the questions raised in \S\ref{sec:notion:action} by considering whether or how the human has changed since the time of the ancient Greeks. The discussion in \S\ref{sec:notion:nature} focusses on those attributes of the person that change over time and how such changes may be observed. The section concludes with the observation that, unlike in Dewey's time, institutions are bent on shaping cultural and social attributes through various means.

Work is then considered within the context of the modern technology, Web 2.0, in \S\ref{sec:Impacts}. Web 2.0, represents a cultural artefact such as that described in \S\ref{sec:notion:action}. There is a distinction drawn between Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web to lay down the technological context that has influenced organisational decision making processes through the application of, for example, Services Oriented Architectures and Software as a Service. Other issues facing enterprises that are addressed in this section include the maximisation of resource use against cost. It is argued that the reliance on information systems which are difficult and costly to change once implemented, \cbdelete{}creates an impediment to organisational responsiveness. The effect of the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies in the enterprise is at present, not well understood. \cbstart{}However, some cases are reasonably well documented. These\cbend{} are discussed, highlighting the potential for positive change in the enterprise and the limitation of negative effects.

The chapter concludes in \S\ref{sec:notion:conclusion}, drawing together the arguments from the previous sections with the conclusion that information systems recognised as Web 2.0, are cultural artefacts that are expressions of the desire existing in the person to communicate, joined with others of their own species. The somewhat unstructured and uncontrolled environment of the social networking scene mirrors a social milieu that is supportive, confirming, open, and in essence, reflects attributes that are found in human nature.

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, a working notion of Work is: that Work is purposeful directed action, with expressions that arise from its property of rationality and purpose.\footnote{\pageref{notionll5}:\ref{notionll5}--\pageref{notionll7}:\ref{notionll7}. \pageref{notionll68}:\ref{notionll68}--\pageref{notionll68a}:\ref{notionll68a}. \pageref{notionll105}:\ref{notionll105}--\pageref{notionll105a}:\ref{notionll105a}. }  Amongst others, the human expression of Work has as its appearance a sense of social status and aspiration. However, humanity is the composition of individuals, thus it stands that as purpose changes, so too does Work. As Work changes, so too do its sense of fulfilment, aspiration, and purpose. Thus, the argument in \S\ref{sec:notion:whatWorkMeans} is that a person's reason to begin Work entails multiple criteria, and that the world in which the any person lives exists within the confines of an economic model. The internal and external pressures of selection determines the nature of a person's Work and to understand the notion of Work, one must see it as a means towards achieving some goal, not as a haphazard idle through space and time. This argument is reflected in the way that, for example, information systems are designed.\footnote{\pageref{notionll27}:\ref{notionll27}--\pageref{notionll27a}:\ref{notionll27a}.} Additionally, when work is undertaken, the use of energy is gradual. Not all of the content of one's energy reserves are expended at once, because the expression of activity involves time and space. In many cases, activities are repetitive and while these may be mundane and offer little stimulation, they must still be done. In many systems design projects, repetitive activities are targeted as opportunities for automation: removing them from the work schedules of workers. However, just as nature tends to present new and different obstacles that require new and different solutions, when activities have been automated or otherwise removed from the work schedule, others appear and take their place.\footnote{\pageref{notionll71}:\ref{notionll71}--\pageref{notionll74a}:\ref{notionll74a}. }}

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, philosophical positions are set against others to establish constants in the appearance of Work. For example, Utilitarianism provides a rationale for working that is tied both to a protestant conception of nature that it is something to be overcome and controlled, that to put oneself to Work is evidence of one's adherence to religious doctrine and performance of one's social duty, and that the worker's role is tied to a strictly defined social order. To Work, in the Utilitarian context provides a social good and the more Work that is undertaken, the greater the benefit for society as a whole.\footnote{\pageref{notionll38}:\ref{notionll38}--\pageref{notionll38a}:\ref{notionll38a}. \pageref{notionll53}:\ref{notionll53}--\pageref{notionll53a}:\ref{notionll53a}. } I argue that Utilitarianism combined with science provided a philosophical basis for productionism. In another example, while conflicts between the philosophies of Smith, \newpage{}\noindent{}Rousseau, \Junger{}, Heidegger, Masaryk, Taylor, Tannenbaum, Locke, Marx, and Engels exist. I argue that the ends for Work are consistent.\footnote{\pageref{notionll41}:\ref{notionll41}--\pageref{notionll41a}:\ref{notionll41a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{The juggernaut is presented in chapter \ref{chap:litrev}. In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, the concept is advanced and I argue that humanity has lost sight of the reason that technology existed. Technology has become the means and the end, where the reference to the juggernaut posits that humanity is now part of technology. The juggernaut is the compound of humanity,\footnote{See \S\ref{sec:intro.human}.} thus humanity, combined with the technology it has created, also comprises the means.\footnote{\pageref{notionll56}:\ref{notionll56}--\pageref{notionll56a}:\ref{notionll56a}. \pageref{notionll76}:\ref{notionll76}--\pageref{notionll76a}:\ref{notionll76a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:intro}, Work is presented objectively and subjectively. In chapter \ref{chap:litrev}, the concept of abstraction is addressed. In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, these approaches are applied as a pragmatist notion of Work, where Work is an epistemic object, such that theory must not deny the metaphysical properties of the person.\footnote{\pageref{notionll77}:\ref{notionll77}--\pageref{notionll77a}:\ref{notionll77a}. \pageref{notionll92}:\ref{notionll92}--\pageref{notionll92a}:\ref{notionll92a}. } Additionally, the notion of artificiality is introduced in chapter \ref{chap:notion} as a new argument, in which artificiality is an imitation of reality and since some thing is made in imitation, it can then be used and applied in varying ways.\footnote{\pageref{notionll88}:\ref{notionll88}--\pageref{notionll88a}:\ref{notionll88a}. } Where artifice is a means of production,\footnote{Creating the artificial entails selecting properties for exclusion. While time moves on, an environment changes. Thus, when the artificial is brought back into nature's environment, it is sometimes difficult to reconcile artificiality with the new environment. To accommodate the disjuncture between the artificial and the changed environment, efforts are made to rationalise about the distinctions by, for example, calling the variances `cultural.' This provides justification for their inclusion.}\footnote{\pageref{notionll108}:\ref{notionll108}--\pageref{notionll108a}:\ref{notionll108a}.\pageref{notionll110}:\ref{notionll110}--\pageref{notionll110a}:\ref{notionll110a}.} then production is spatiotemporally defined and Work is the action of producing.\footnote{\pageref{notionll82}:\ref{notionll82}--\pageref{notionll82a}:\ref{notionll82a}.} An illustration offered is the information system: the information system is artificial, from the standpoint that it is built in imitation of the human act. That is, information systems perform activities and tasks that would previously have been undertaken by a person. Information systems, as technology, are designed from some purpose and according to sets of rules and where these attributes are quantitative.\footnote{\pageref{notionll95}:\ref{notionll95}--\pageref{notionll95a}:\ref{notionll95a}.}}

\newpage{}
\ColourTextRed{I extend the argument, in which Peirce's pragmatism maxim suggests that the validation of the design of information systems ought to be tested against all factors that were incorporated in the initial design stage.\footnote{See \S\ref{sec:intro.Philosophy}. \pageref{notionll98}:\ref{notionll98}--\pageref{notionll98a}:\ref{notionll98a}. \pageref{introll84}:\ref{introll84}--\pageref{introll84}:\ref{introll84}.} Knowledge of the existence of the information system provides evidence that it not only exists, but that the observer is part of the environment in which the information system exists. Therefore, testing all parts of the information system entails the inclusion of its environment, including the observer. The observer is irrevocably connected to the information system. As the observer makes changes, changes are effected in the observer. This creates a distinction between theory and practice: objects of knowledge can exist outside environmental effects, but objects in nature cannot escape. Doctrine exists outside spatiotemporal confines and is the reason why Dewey warns that objects of knowledge must also pass the test of common sense.\footnote{\pageref{notionll101}:\ref{notionll101}--\pageref{notionll101a}:\ref{notionll101a}. \pageref{notionll151}:\ref{notionll151}--\pageref{notionll151a}:\ref{notionll151a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, a second new argument is presented: that the world of nature has mechanism but while this allows nature to be observable and predictable (to a degree), it is often seemingly irrational.\footnote{\pageref{notionll113}:\ref{notionll113}--\pageref{notionll113a}:\ref{notionll113a}. } Mechanism is often complex and not easy to discern \emph{in situ}, so science observes from outside the natural environment to facilitate clarity of understanding. That is, to remove an object from its complex set of relationships provides the opportunity to build rationality. The problem with taking \emph{ex situ} observations is that even then; environmental factors cannot be completely removed. Often, observations of phenomena vary as a result and it is necessary to identify common effects from experimentation.\footnote{\pageref{notionll116}:\ref{notionll116}--\pageref{notionll116a}:\ref{notionll116a}.} In the field of \IS{}, observations of phenomena from other fields are commonly applied in the design of information systems. The application of objective knowledge from various epistemic foundations is fraught with complicating issues that arise from competing and conflicting requirements for adaption and change, from various artificialities, to one continuously changing reality.\footnote{\pageref{notionll119}:\ref{notionll119}--\pageref{notionll119a}:\ref{notionll119a}.} I find some agreement with Nietzsche's argument: that the purpose of humanity is to satisfy the Will to Will. I contend that the person has choice, but it is when their Will is of the same kind as that of the technological system that they may choose only those options that are allowed by the system. For the person who submits to the greater power of the system, they will find they no longer have choice.\footnote{\pageref{notionll171}:\ref{notionll171}--\pageref{notionll171a}:\ref{notionll171a}. } When the person is reduced to the status of artificiality, then the person may be steered and the technological system provides the cybernetic authority. The person who is thus steered has abdicated their sense of self.\footnote{\pageref{notionll173}:\ref{notionll173}--\pageref{notionll173a}:\ref{notionll173a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{A third new argument is presented in chapter \ref{chap:notion}: that systems tend toward entropy.\footnote{\pageref{notionll141}:\ref{notionll141}--\pageref{notionll141a}:\ref{notionll141a}. \pageref{notionll144}:\ref{notionll144}--\pageref{notionll144a}:\ref{notionll144a}.} I assert that the manner in which information systems are designed preclude the possibility or ease of alteration or change. Alteration or change may be either at the system or enterprise level. A second resistor to alteration or change is preservationist thinking: that which provides for a stable and predictable systems environment. A third resistor to alteration or change is the perceived need for security that \emph{in reductio}, can only be achieved in a hermetic system. In other realities, there exist variances in levels of security and increasing levels of security increases entropy. The subsequent effect that these influences have on the enterprise is to stymie growth, reactivity to external pressures, and responsiveness.}

\ColourTextRed{A fourth new argument in chapter \ref{chap:notion} extends Nietzsche's argument of the Will to Will: that the knowledge worker produces information for the sake of producing more information, but information has connections to both itself and the natural world (where it is referential). In cases where information references people: information production that does not take into account the requirement for ethical use is a threat to confidentiality and security. However, as information production outstrips ethical deliberations, levels of acceptability have varied and the widespread nature of change signals a cultural shift.\footnote{\pageref{notionll147}:\ref{notionll147}--\pageref{notionll147a}:\ref{notionll147a}.} }

\ColourTextRed{A fifth new argument in chapter \ref{chap:notion} states that one must seek for one's humanity inside the technological system: to bend the system to the will of the human.\footnote{\pageref{notionll160}:\ref{notionll160}--\pageref{notionll160a}:\ref{notionll160a}.} The view that humanity is not a perpetual victim of the industrial system conveys the attitude that humanity will not be held back from what it chooses for itself. Web 2.0 provides mechanism for humanity to subversively regain its Dasein, inside the system.\footnote{\pageref{notionll163}:\ref{notionll163}--\pageref{notionll163a}:\ref{notionll163a}. }  Not all humanity has given away its beingness. The expressive quality of the person, its creativity, cannot be extinguished because it is a property of humanity.\footnote{\pageref{notionll177}:\ref{notionll177}--\pageref{notionll177a}:\ref{notionll177a}.}}

\section{What Work means to the person} \label{sec:notion:whatWorkMeans}
\nobreak
It is easy, when considering the subject of Work to branch off into discussions of economic theory, such as the notion that at one time the labour theory of value was attributed to goods \cbdelete{}\cite<for example>{Ricardo1821,Marx1998}. However, while I do not intend to be thus diverted, \linelabel{notionll27}the reasonable person must accept that Work, in the context of the modern person, cannot be removed entirely from reasons for why Work is undertaken and most often, and for most, those reasons are economic. In discussing the notion of Work, I am referring to Work as that effort applied to achieve a specific goal rather than as some bricolage, in which whatever artefact produced appears as the result of haphazard attempts at solving some ill-defined purpose. I take this approach because \IS{} planning, design, and development requires that produced artefacts meet requirements that have been established during the design process. \linelabel{notionll27a}

\newpage{}\cbstart{}To paraphrase \citeA{Smith1937},\cbend{} Work is the real price of everything.\footnote{A comparison is drawn between Smith's reference to labour and Work, where they are both purposeful and directed action.} That \cbstart{}is,\cbend{} Work is the effort required to transform those things that are in a natural or raw state into those other things\cbdelete{} people want or desire. Smith's economy is based on the notion that the Work of one person's transformation of raw material into an item of value is met by the Work of another who desires that thing, having put effort into the creation of another thing which might be valued by the first~\cite{DupreGagnier1996}. Since Smith, the labour theory of value has been replaced by the concepts of use-value and exchange-value because items produced by either worker are rarely theirs to do with, as they will. Instead, workers are more likely to have exchanged their labour for a~money~wage.

\citeA{Tannenbaum1952} points out that Work fulfils more than just an economic role, but that its role is also social and moral.\label{text:notion:moral} Indeed, he says that the ``vacuum between the job and the man has proved intolerable; and it cannot be filled with higher wages, shorter hours, better conditions of labour, music in the shops, or baby clinics''~\citeyear[p.~105]{Tannenbaum1952}. More must exist in the relationship between worker and their industry than purely personal pecuniary gain.

While \citeA{Locke1980} considers that Work is an essentially good thing and as a means to end, it leads to the accumulation of wealth and divine fulfilment. \cbdelete{}For \citeA{Marx1998}, Work is not only purposeful in its own right. \cbstart{}Work is\cbend{} the worker's purpose for working and their labour ought to be united in the person of the worker. \cbend{}When these are separated, they are little more than an ant driven by instinct. Such division reached its extreme interpretation under the capitalist Taylorist production~environment. 

Some four decades after Taylor, \citeA{Tannenbaum1952} says that the worker has to belong to something real, purposeful, useful, and creative. He says that these attributes are part of the worker's being and that they must belong to their industry or the industry belongs to them. Either way, the two are permanently linked to each other but ``what gnaws at the psychological and moral roots of the contemporary worker is that most urban people, workers and owners, belong to nothing real''~\citeyear[p.~106]{Tannenbaum1952}. \cbstart{}For the displaced worker, there is nothing greater than the expectation of monetary reward. \cbend{}

\citeA{Berthoud2007} says Rousseau's \cbstart{}teachings tell us\cbend{} that Work teaches wisdom about time and a sense of \cbstart{}self and reality that\cbend{} protects everybody from imagination, passions, and society's harms. This view is wildly utopian \label{text:notion:utopian} and more likely is the pragmatic reality that the ``majority of people in contemporary societies do not do the kinds of work that could be a source of self-fulfilment, even when they share liberal notions of the self''~~\cite{DupreGagnier1996}.  \citeauthor{Berthoud2007} casts a critical light on Engel's notion of Work, that Work does not lead the individual to some kind of human existence, but rather leads away from it. He reports Rousseau's conception that Work is an access to economy, but Rousseau's economy exists under the rule of the use-value system and that it is qualitative.

\textls[12]{While for many, Work means a succession of small and unpleasant tasks that no-one really likes to do~\cite{Masaryk1971}, utopian romantics like \citeA{Junger2007} present heroes performing great deeds or perhaps laying down their lives for some greater good.\footnote{Note that his view changed in later years when the anarch~\cite{Junger1977} became representative of the ideal person. Maintaining a separation between the person and their appointed role that enables the anarch\label{text:notion:anarch} to facilitate their goals and desires while not falling victim to the vicissitudes of those who might lay claim to power. } \linelabel{notionll38}The utilitarian approach would be that what is essential are the daily chores that need to be completed so that life is facilitated. Working is the constant fight against ugliness, wickedness, evil wherever and whenever they appear. All that is needed are perseverance and fearlessness.\linelabel{notionll38a} \Junger{} defined Work as: the representation of the Gestalt of the worker~\cite{Zimmerman1990}.\label{text:notion:gestalt} Gestalt is not another name for being but is the beingness that grounds entities and from Heidegger's viewpoint, ``\Junger{} spoke as if technological humanity transformed itself into the meaning-giver and ground-bestower to all things. Heidegger maintained, by way of contrast, that humanity has been transformed into the worker because `to be' means `to be worked upon and transformed in accordance with the imperative of production for its~own~sake.' ''~\citeyear[p.~82]{Zimmerman1990}.}

For \citeA{Masaryk1971} Work is not all excited, noisy bustling and striving. \linelabel{notionll41}Work also occurs in inactivity, in watching. Work is not the ideal, the ultimate end, but the means. \cbstart{}Moreover,\cbend{} this raises the \cbstart{}question: what\cbend{} are the ends? Those ends are economic gain, a sense of fulfilment, the facilitation of life, or the legitimisation of religious doctrine or utopian ideals.\label{text:notion:utopia}\linelabel{notionll41a}


\section{Reason for Work} \label{sec:notion:Reason}
\nobreak
In \S\ref{sec:notion:Reason}, the reasons that Work has become a principal feature in the life of the person are discussed. First the discussion highlights the Nietzschean conception of the system's Will to Will in \S\ref{sec:meaningOfWork}, that is the person accepts the obligation to Work in order to satisfy the Will of the system, and that there is little to differentiate the Will of the person from that of the system itself. In \S\ref{sec:notion:HowToWork}, the quality of Work that the person engages in becomes a factor in why they choose to Work, or the Work that they choose to do. The argument is put forward that while Work is categorised as mental and physical, in any case, Work must provide for the worker physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual nourishment. Finally, in \S\ref{sec:notion:humanObject}, the person is shown that they have little power in their Work and is thus objectified. The person who adopts the role of Work assumes the role of the worker who exists to be exploited through, for example, the adoption of the principles of Scientific Management.

\subsection{The Will to Work} \label{sec:meaningOfWork}
\nobreak
\textls[6]{\citeA{Zimmerman1990} says it is the Will to Will that calls the populace to Work and that it was Nietzsche who made willing an end unto itself. Will is the unconditioned subjectivity of life to become ever stronger, such that the Will to Power is comparable to Will to Will: the aimless striving for ever more striving. The only limitation to the expansion of Will is Will itself. The Will to Will expresses itself in human terms through the domination of powers as Will seeks to extend its boundaries over previous gains. The Will to Will is driven on by the perception that what has gone before is lesser, weaker, or no longer relevant. The play of power can be seen in the manner in which scientific research is undertaken, where findings are disclosed as a means to render down previous findings. The idea that truth, whether Cartesian or Greek, should play a part in the production of such outcomes is outmoded. Truth no longer has a place: \cbstart{}the\cbend{} scientific method has given way to the Will to Will~\cite{Nietzsche1987}. The Will to extend the bounds of the Will itself is victorious over the Will to find truth.}

\linelabel{notionll53}There exists in the nature of the person an urge to engage in the constant struggle to overcome the forces of nature and bend her to its will. Technology has evolved from that desire and, particularly in the industrial and post-industrial revolutionary era, that was a driving motivation for ever larger and more complex machines. To improve the lot of the person, it became an act of Will that the person should gain power and mastery over \cbstart{}nature's chaos.\cbend{} However, Heidegger argues that humanity has become \cbstart{}slave to that power and that technological producing is the enactment of enslavement.\cbend{}\linelabel{notionll53a}

\linelabel{notionll56}The person has become the means by which technology is produced and \cbdelete{}the ends are beyond imagining or ken. Thus, the person becomes an object in the juggernaut\footnote{See the comment about the juggernaut in footnote \ref{text:litrev:juggernaut} on p. \pageref{text:litrev:juggernaut}.} that is the technological system and their Will is lost to that of the whole. The Will of the person exists only to magnify the Will of the system and so the result is\cbdelete{} the Will to Will that is also the call to Work.\linelabel{notionll56a}

\subsection{How to Work} \label{sec:notion:HowToWork}
\nobreak
In a series of lectures delivered in 1898 at the University of Prague entitled \emph{How to Work},  \citeA{Masaryk1971} draws a distinction between two types of work: mental and physical. The former is administrative and directive; the latter is the rough work of the labourer. The mental worker, he says, is the new proletariat.

The mental worker displays two types of phenomena: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item will and effort that is regarded as work, and
\item imagination that is emotional and subjective.
\end{inparaenum}
In either case, discrimination and judgement are seen as active, and the search for truth and arriving at conclusions are purposeful. \linelabel{notionll68}Physical work involves effort, but that is confined mainly to the stresses required to move the electro-skeleto-muscular framework around. There is also fatigue that arises from mental work that is from the emotion, psychology, and mental effort.\linelabel{notionll68a}

Nature is cyclic and this makes for the periodicity of toil~\cite{Masaryk1971} although for the person \cbstart{}who is thus engaged,\cbend{} they may not be aware of that and only see themselves as slogging through the days and weeks while performing tasks that are neither meaningful nor pleasant. \linelabel{notionll71}Work therefore, is the means and force exerted to overcome a difficulty and this must be achieved periodically rather than in one large, all consuming effort towards resolution. \cbdelete{}Utilitarianism\cbdelete{} put the worker to task by completing those assignments that are essential to facilitate life, the daily chores that must be completed. Nevertheless, is it utopian to consider getting rid of such vulgar and mundane tasks? Perhaps some may be done away with, but others are inevitably added in their place.\linelabel{notionll71a}

\newpage{}\textls[8]{\linelabel{notionll74}In all Work, there is an element of tedium and in many respects that is what is `vulgar.' In our days of computation and automation, processes are defined atomically to the extent that the worker's life becomes one of relentless dreariness. For example, in previous decades the worker might have had call to go to an archive with a sheaf of requests, they or the attendant would then have to shuffle through records to find the desired information, amendments might be made, the records reordered and returned to their place in the archive. Nowadays this is done with the click of a mouse, the hitting of keys on a keyboard. The worker barely needs to raise their buttock cheeks with the effort.\linelabel{notionll74a}}

\linelabel{notionll76}Thus, the worker of today is the subject of small and mean tasks.\linelabel{notionll76a} Consider the Zen principle that nourishment is provided to the body, the mind, and the soul and that one's food must be of different colours, shapes, and textures because \linelabel{notionll77}it is the whole person that is being nourished and not just their physical self. It is more than just the provision of proteins, sugars, carbohydrates and so on, but also the impressions provided by colour, texture, smell, sound and of course, taste. Work requires effort but it also provides nourishment of a kind. The mind is fed by stimuli and the soul by balance. The worker of today needs more than just streamlined processes to facilitate efficient transactions to keep them engaged, they also need to have balance in the various parts of their lives, especially through their emotions, and they need stimulus. Without these, the worker becomes subject to their small and mean tasks, and the result of that is frustration and fatigue.\linelabel{notionll77a}

\subsection{The person becomes the object} \label{sec:notion:humanObject}
\nobreak
The principles under which Scientific Management was established allowed for new conceptions of Work. Space and time were reframed such that for workers, Work is their only reality~\cite{Heidegger1981} and Work is work for the sake of more work~\cite{Zimmerman1990} where Work is a function of the industrial machine. \linelabel{notionll82}Work is then tied to the boundary conditions of time as a material property of production. The functionalisation of time and Work refers to the binding of the worker to the time clock in an industrial plant. \linelabel{notionll82a}

In an effort to understand the impact of industrialisation in Germany, the Frankfurt School was established and it found that ``the very system of industrial production that was supposed to liberate humanity, not only had altered the institutions of society, but also had changed the character structure of the members of the working class. Industrial modes of production tend to make people more authoritarian, more willing to accept a passive position in a hierarchical society. Instead of being an emancipatory factor in human history, then, industrialism threatens to become a more complex form of enslavement, one legitimated by the `dictates' of efficiency, rationality, and technical expertise''~\cite[p.~217]{Zimmerman1990}.

\linelabel{notionll88}For the person, their new reality is the artificial, but artificiality for the person is not foreign. Artificiality for the person is a natural part of its being. The person makes symbols and always has, for as long as it has been able to conceive of dimensions beyond itself. Whereas the person of ancient times created symbols as a means to understand themself and relations within and between nature and super-nature, now the person has become a mere symbol, an object. As an object, the person may be framed according to need and exigency; it is devoid of unique and identifying features. When the object-person is defined as a role within a plant, then \cbstart{}the person no longer exists, the person is reduced to\cbend{} a mere one page description to which supplicants may~apply~themselves.\linelabel{notionll88a}

\section{The notion of action} \label{sec:notion:action}
\nobreak
\cbstart{}Unlike Rousseau's~\citeyear{Rousseau1968} qualitative conception that Work is an access to an economy under the use-value system,\cbend{}\linelabel{notionll92} there exists a quantitative distinction between the act and the person. The role of the person is the expression of what is possible for any instance of human action and is limited to that instance's ability to embody either, the full, or some partial measure of the potential act. The \cbstart{}products\cbend{} of the person's role in action are cultural artefacts and, where they may be put to use and therefore have some value, are qualitative.\linelabel{notionll92a}

\linelabel{notionll95}As a cultural artefact, information systems emulate the human act. That is, information systems are conceived in response to need and embodied conceptions are limited to the imaginative capacity of the conceiver. The conception of artefacts may be limited by factors that range from the quality of the conceiver's education, the availability of technology to facilitate further expressions of what may be possible, and political, economic, cultural and social limitations in the context of where the information system will be conceived.\linelabel{notionll95a}

\linelabel{notionll98}These factors present themselves as problems to be solved in the formation of the information system. The issue of how to resolve problems, according to the objects of knowledge that have been built around perceptions gained from a process of abstractive thought, is essentially practical in nature. At some point, it is necessary to test conceptions through experimentation, that is, to take action. There is no great revelation in this view. Action is fundamental to universal interaction and when interaction occurs in which the consequences of life-processes are to be effected, at some point in the future, then that process is called an act. Thus, if knowing occurs in nature, then knowing is an existential overt act. That is, knowing within nature modifies what already existed there and its worth amounts to how much change took place. In the positivist perception of science is the ability of the observer to stand apart from nature and \cbstart{}observe\cbend{} from outside a process. \cbdelete{}Such observations can only occur in those cases where it can be demonstrated that there has been no modification of the \cbstart{}observed environment,\cbend{} through the observation itself. \linelabel{notionll98a}

That observations of nature can be called scientific only when there has been no demonstrable effect on the environment as a result of the observation begs the question: When then does the idea that science is able to step outside the reality of everyday experience, to experiment with but not affect nature? \citeA{Dewey1891} suggests that this spectator theory of knowing was likely \cbend{}inevitability since thought was regarded as an exercise of the process of reason, separate from the body, and through which truth was obtained. So then, what is the relationship that exists between knowledge and action? \linelabel{notionll101}I argue that conclusions from knowledge arise from changes in ideas, and \cbstart{}changes\cbend{} are effected from the imputation of action. Thus, there exists a distinction between knowledge that arises from theory and that, which comes as the result of experience and practice.\linelabel{notionll101a}

\linelabel{notionll105}Just as there is a distinction between theory and practice, so there is a distinction between two kinds of action in which one is intelligent and the other blind. \cbstart{}Blind action takes place unknowingly, has no understanding of past or future events, is controlled by external factors without recourse, and has no ken of consequences.\cbend{} Intelligent action is that which is directed, it is represented by acts that display qualities of instruction, information, knowledge, and it carries `purpose.' If intelligent action is purposive action and if the action is a phenomenon of natural occurrence that takes place under specifiable conditions, then `purpose' (like intelligence) is within nature and `purpose' therefore is a \emph{category} having standing and validity.\linelabel{notionll105a} \citeA{Dewey1891} points out that distinctively human conduct can be understood only in terms of `purpose' and \cbstart{}distinctively human action\cbend{} is marked by its `intent.'\linelabel{notionll105b} 

\linelabel{notionll108}While `purpose' is ascribed to nature because the person is part of the natural world, when parts of nature are studied, they are removed from their environment. The isolation of bits of nature also excludes the concept of `purpose,' but science is full with these kinds of abstraction. By a curious reversal, much of archaeological anthropology is about reattaching `purpose' to objects that are found in a natural context, in which clues are extracted from the surrounding material and conditions. \linelabel{notionll108a}

\linelabel{notionll110}Similarly, it is a common approach in the design of systems to redefine the `purpose' of \IT{} artefacts as examples of cultural artefacts, suggesting that they are mutable. It is through the imputation of the human act that `purposes' are ascribed to artefacts.\linelabel{notionll110a} \cbstart{}\citeA[p.~236]{Dewey1939}\cbend{} agrees when he says acts ``are viewed in their connections, as it is surely the province of philosophy to view them, nature is seen to be marked by histories, some of which terminate in the existence of human beings and finally in their intelligent activities.'' 

\linelabel{notionll113}Nature that has purpose, use, function, and more, has mechanism. Mechanism in philosophy is the doctrine that all natural phenomena are explicable by material causes and mechanical principles, and so nature has this as a feature. \cbdelete{}Mechanism\cbdelete{} forms the content of objects investigated in the physical sciences. It would not be the case if through experimentation it were demonstrated that there were significant variations between occurrences because in this case, there could be no uniformity or constancy such that predictions and inferences would not be possible. So it stands that much of scientific thought is about the subject-matter of the relations between constants, and that since not all observations will produce the same results due to environmental variations, they are statistical in nature. Such observations are not descriptions of the exact structure or behaviour of every individual thing, but what is reasonable to expect. \linelabel{notionll113a}

\linelabel{notionll116}No mechanically exact science of the person is possible, since such an investigation would need to take into account its history and any environmental changes that have occurred during its existence. However, those constituents of the person that are known are derived as statistical constants from a series of operations. In this regard, physical knowing is taken as typical of the nature of knowing. The trust given to this approach comes from operations that are perfected and the scheme of symbols that are well tested. Science obtains of credence as an intensive form of gathering knowledge, one that provides a powerful tool for providing other modes of knowledge.\linelabel{notionll116a}

\linelabel{notionll119}Applying the argument that application of the scientific method results in knowledge that is made available for use in other modes, then it holds that in the field of \IS{} knowledge from related fields is \cbdelete{}applied in the design and implementation of \cbstart{}information systems (the \IT{} artefact).\cbend{}\label{text:notion:artefact} In practice, the context in which information systems are designed and built is subject to variable rates of change. \cbstart{}Change requires the systems designer to make adaptation so that the system will function within an altered context.\cbend{} \cbdelete{}From these considerations emerge two questions: Will this change also result in changes in the person who engages with the systems' iterations? Will exposure to these systems have a cumulative effect on the fundamental nature of the person?\linelabel{notionll119a}

\section{Change in the nature of the human} \label{sec:notion:nature}
\nobreak
\citeA{Dewey1938} seeks to answer the question of whether human nature changes when working conditions also change. Treating the question as one that is essentially practical, his initial thoughts point towards the affirmative, that human nature does change. But linking his argument back to the effort to find constants in nature, and in particular that of the human, Dewey takes this opportunity to bring into the argument, considerations of what does \emph{not} change in human nature. One such factor is that the \cbstart{}human's biological needs have not changed;\cbend{} it still needs food, air water, to reproduce and nurture its young.

\cbstart{}Physical requirements of the human, says \citeA{Dewey1938},\cbend{} appear to be ingrained in its nature along with others that do not appear to satisfy the physical form immediately, the need for companionship, the need to exhibit power over others and its environment, and so on. \cbstart{}However,\cbend{} these examples, while integral, would not be human nature if they changed. \cbstart{}To differentiate between what is fixed and permanent, one needs to look at which constants appear to change and under what conditions. For\cbend{} example, someone who refuses food must have something wrong with them and, within a given cultural environment, those who exist within it would tend to view askance anyone from outside if they should happen to refuse the food that is eaten on a daily basis. So while the fact that food as a necessity is a constant, regardless of culture, for a given situation the \cbstart{}selections\cbend{} of foods are of no less importance. By comparison, Dewey cites Aristotle\label{text:notion:aristotle} and the rest of his society's claim that slavery was a natural occurrence. Aristotle would not have understood calls for the abolition of slavery, because for his and his kin, there was no point in taking the effort to change what is in human nature, and what is therefore immutable. In their view, there were those for whom being a master over others and to have power over them was natural.\cbdelete{}

The reluctance to accept changes in nature that are imposed through the calls of, for example, radical elements, or those that come to an institution because the society in which it operates has already changed, and those are percolating throughout it is likely a case of the inertia of custom. That \cbstart{}it takes time\cbend{} to get accustomed to the idea that habits have formed and that they must be reformed. In finding the answer to the question, \citeA{Dewey1938} says to take into account first, the force required to maintain and change existing traditions and customs that represent the patterns of action and belief. 

In order to execute change, when the resistance to change comes from cultural structures, it is wise to find out what forces are already at work. When one has identified the forces that already exist, they can be reinforced so that their moment is directed towards the desired change, gradually weakening the conditions that prevent change. 

The idea that changes cannot be condoned or are impossible because of the fixed constitution of human nature, such as was the case with the Aristotle's ancient Greeks, is no more than a diversion of attention away from the other question, of how to go about it. Instead of dealing with the nature of change required, the objection brings into the array blind emotion and brutish ignorance. In the end, it serves to encourage those who think that change is best effected with a liberal dosage of violence, evidence of which can be viewed on the nightly news.

The question now is, how to most effectively modify human nature. Indeed, with so many institutions clamouring to make changes to the way people think, act, and respond, with methods that vary from punitive force, to emotional blackmail, to chemical solutions to perceived problems, it would perhaps be a welcome change if one could wind the clock back to 1938, when \citeauthor{Dewey1938} was more concerned about the absence of human sciences. Nevertheless, the best solution, then and now, is through the application of education in its widest sense.

\section{Web 2.0 in Work} \label{sec:Impacts}
\nobreak
The Semantic Web or as it is often referred to, Web 2.0, represents a fundamental leap in cognisance, in the way that information is treated and regarded. In the leap, \linelabel{notionll138}the distance covered ranges from the idea that information is made up from data that have been made useful, to one in which new information is created from unplanned, unexpected, and unintended linkages between data and data, data and information, or information and information.\linelabel{notionll138a} Web 2.0 promises an Internet that \cbstart{}allows greater participation,\cbend{} with applications that allow anyone to create and publish their own content. Common examples are forums, wikis, and blogs that enable na\"i{}ve users to publish content \cbstart{}with\cbend{} templates and preset options. \citeauthor{Maximilien2007}~\citeyear{Maximilien2007} point out a distinction between the Semantic Web and Web 2.0, saying that the Semantic Web has its roots in \textsc{ai} and academia \cite<see for example,>{Dietrich2007} and that is a reason why its uptake has been relatively limited compared with Web 2.0 technologies.\footnote{See page \ref{text:litrev:artefact2}.} \cbdelete{}\cbstart{}Web 2.0 has been shown to increase value, reduce cost, and improve communications and open new channels for communication. Integration in heterogeneous environments can be facilitated using interchange formats, as well as the delivery of applications in geographically distributed situations.\cbend{}

\linelabel{notionll141}However, as with cultural objects, systems tend toward entropy. As efforts are made to address the concerns of the organisation, so that information systems are developed to meet perceived demands and requirements, then information systems are further embedded into the organisation, thus the organisation becomes ever more tightly bound by the processes that were intended to free it. The by-product of this is the effort, to not be wasted, that becomes subject to preservationist thinking so that systems become stabilised.\cbdelete{} Security measures ensure that new systems become increasingly difficult to implement or subsequent changes made to existing systems. Ultimately the systems become impediments to efficiencies. Entropic systems stymie corporate growth and development. As information systems have become increasingly embedded into the corporate structure, their tendency towards entropy\linelabel{notion141b} also becomes a factor, resisting the ability for the corporation to shift and change. While the essential problem appears to be technological, in reality it lies in the natural instinct in the person to resist change, thus the solution lies there. \linelabel{notionll141a}

A corporation remains dynamic when it maintains a moral and psychological milieu~\cite{Tannenbaum1952} that brings into being almost infinite possibilities, ideas, and processes. \linelabel{notionll144}The threat of failure and loss in adopting new technologies and the efforts to mitigate those losses are the very same forces that cause an entropic response.\linelabel{notionll144a}

While there is an increasing volume of published research on the technological aspects of Web 2.0 and how applications can be implemented, there is relatively little published on the impact of newer technologies on Work, Work Systems, or the impact on workers. In this instance, events in the world are far outreaching the efforts of researchers. Significant company mergers have taken place, major marketing campaigns that involve social networking applications, political battles that are conducted on public forums, and militant organisations that gain international support by distributing recordings of their messages~\cite{Constantinides2008}. \linelabel{notionll147}All these illustrate how the person has been educated about how to make use of information for \cbstart{}his or her\cbend{} own purposes. The knowledge worker truly has become that, a worker of knowledge for its own ends. Such ex-societal uses of information are presented as threats to the status \cbstart{}quo. Such threats represent\cbend{} a cultural shift in permission and acceptance.\linelabel{notionll147a}

\textls[8]{There are increasing numbers of enterprises experimenting with Web 2.0 technologies~\cite<for example>{Koch2007,Rowe2006,Yi2006} but as with anything new, there are concerns from businesses. Some concerns expressed include security, return on investment, and their staffs' skill in implementing and integrating new technologies with legacy systems~\cite{Hoover2007}. According to \citeA{BernersLee1998}, Web 2.0 ought to represent a consistent level of semantic interoperability and applications should be sharing services or where necessary, \cbstart{}be self updating,\cbend{} and universally applied standards should be implemented. It is expected that  historical problems associated with the integration of heterogeneous environments should be somewhat alleviated~\cite{Kobielus2007}. Indeed, it is becoming a predominant paradigm in the development of distributed software systems because web services can provide the potential for software to be modularised in a way that functionality can be described, discovered and deployed over a network \cbstart{}to maintain\cbend{} platform independence~\cite{Bell2007}.}

Users of Internet- and Intranet-based information systems interact with them in ways that are often different or new. This was especially the case at BT where the non-promoted \cbstart{}releases\cbend{} of tools were quickly taken up by a large number of staff. \citeA{Dennison2007} reported that \cbstart{}enterprises need\cbend{} realistic expectations about what can be achieved because the nature of the interactions making social media successful does not necessarily translate to the corporate environment. \linelabel{notionll151}However, that also means that those who have responsibility in the enterprise for internal and external communications and policies need to be involved early on and they need to understand that it is not a fixed set of processes and tools, but that it shifts and changes according to context.\linelabel{notionll151a} The introduction of social media tools at BT was more a proof of concept and \citeA{Dennison2007} says that they were somewhat taken by surprise by its popularity. He has advised that it is a good idea to start small and make adaptations to the system, then offer tools that people want to use, and to remove tools that are not being used. Then offer tools as soon as they are available, in beta form, and leave the users to decide early on whether they want them or not. Nevertheless, they found their implementation was quickly overwhelmed and efforts to expand the system were frustrated when the provider was bought by a competitor who obsoleted the platform.

IBM realised  there is a rising expectation among some the new generation of employees that they can add, change, or update content in real time~\cite{MajchrzakCherbakovIves2009} and it is a prime requirement to be able to have direct access to the latest data or content and, as such, direct access to components of an organisation's value chain. Having this level of access is seen as a given, along with the ability to make changes to or reconfigure internal processes~\cite{Butler2000}. Successful implementation of a number of focussed and well developed tools at IBM taught the enterprise that the Internet has been integrated into people's lives to such a degree that the introduction of Web 2.0 tools did not substantially change how people work, so that there was little to change in peoples' work habits. The tools also promoted a greater sense of opportunity and therefore innovation, because attitudes toward production changed. Rather than monitoring activities that people were involved in, postings on ThinkPlace and Beehive were analysed to identify staff outcomes. This had led to a focus on mass collaboration, and in a sense, has promulgated the `wisdom of the crowd.' In the BT case, this \cbstart{}conception\cbend{} was questioned because of the much smaller population involved.

\citeA{MajchrzakCherbakovIves2009} supports the view of  \citeA{Gruber2008}, that Web 2.0 represents a  set of tools allowing for collective bargaining, argument, and decision making. As well, the IBM case adds weight to \citeA{Rahwan2007}, where the use of Web 2.0 has created a field of intellectual freedom where opinions and argument can be presented. This in turn enables the application of large-scale argumentation, and innovation is encouraged because there is freedom for different views to be presented, challenged, and evaluated by contributors and readers. 

\citeA{Kazikawa2007} says that Web 2.0 tools challenge traditional institutional boundaries by drawing the decision making power down from higher levels of management and giving greater autonomy to teams who can communicate openly. At FCC, \citeA{SmithMcKeen2008}  reported an improvement in effective communication between business units and the \IT{} department. The introduction of \soa{} also gave an opportunity for business managers to focus on processes, while \IT{} managers focussed on enabling them with technology. At IBM, there existed a unofficial gap between long serving staff and new recruits. \cbdelete{}The introduction of Web 2.0 tools, in particular social media tools, provided a space where such inter-generational gaps could be closed. This also has been observed by \citeA{Shiumazu2007}, who say that open communication can occur if close linkages between a variety of communication tools and job systems exist and where frameworks are in place to support their development. 

\linelabel{notionll160}I have said that Work is the effort required to transform \cbdelete{}things that are in a natural or raw state into \cbdelete{}things that people want or desire. \cbstart{}I have also said that Work is more than just an economic role, its role is also social and moral and to that extent, the worker belongs to something real, purposeful, useful, and creative. \cbdelete{}The ends of Work ought to include factors that connect humanity to its Dasein: \cbdelete{}that either they belong to their industry, or the industry belongs to them where the two are permanently linked. Of course in any industry, a pattern of repetitive behaviour and action that is attached to every role must exist, making the person redundant, where the person is abstracted and recognised only as an object.\cbend{}\linelabel{notionll160a}

\linelabel{notionll163}\cbstart{}While the role of the worker is a symbol separated from the beingness of the person, humanity has shown the tendency to do the unexpected and reveal that technology has no fixed trajectory. Unexpected effects show that technology may face disruption,\cbend{} especially when it has become entropic \cbstart{}or subject to competitive forces.\cbend{} To limit the adverse effects of revolutionary disruption, the enlightened organisation ought to maintain a moral and psychological milieu that in turn allows its workers scope for creativity and expression. Web 2.0 information systems provide just such a symbol that, as a cultural artefact, emulates human nature. Therefore, while the notion of Work is that it is purposeful directed action, the purpose itself is mutable and so then is Work.\linelabel{notionll163a}

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:notion:conclusion}
\nobreak
It \cbstart{}has been stated that\cbend{} Work serves to fulfill a largely economic role in the life of the person, the benefit that Work provides extends well beyond \cbstart{}the boundary of the industrial plant.\cbend{} Work provides social and moral sustenance to the person, that the person needs more than just a fair wage; they need to belong to something purposeful, useful, \cbstart{}and creative and for the person, satisfies the urge to be and to feel their humanity.\cbend{}

Such concerns as these bring into question the reason that a person would engage in Work. Nietzsche would argue that the person works to satisfy the system's Will to Will. In working to satisfy the system's Will, to produce for the sake of more production the person accepts their obligation to Work in order to satisfy the Will of the system. \linelabel{notionll171}The Will of the person then becomes of the same kind as that of the system\cbdelete{}. It may be said that Work has qualities: \cbstart{}that\cbend{} what the person seeks to obtain from Work is the quality of Work that the person \cbstart{}chooses to engage, which\cbend{} becomes a factor in why they choose to Work and the Work \cbdelete{}they choose to do. \cbdelete{}When the person accepts that \cbdelete{}the system's Will\cbdelete{} is superior to their own, then the person has little power in their Work and is thus objectified and made\cbdelete{} exploitable.\linelabel{notionll171a}

\linelabel{notionll173}The person-object, thus created, whose Will is that of the system, is steered towards the creation of artefacts that emulate human actions. \cbstart{}Such cultural artefacts include\cbend{} information systems \cbstart{}that\cbend{} are designed to solve human problems. However, the creation of the person-object entails that some change has gone on in the nature of the person, which Dewey discusses in relation to the role the person plays in society, and how changing roles reflect changes in society. He says that the fundamental nature of the person does not change, that is, the person still needs to eat, sleep, has arms and legs, and so on. \cbstart{}However,\cbend{} culturally significant changes have been observed and if culture is part of the person, then the person has changed too. \linelabel{notionll173a}

\linelabel{notionll177}While efforts have been made since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to create an image of the ideal worker (with images striking a variety of forms from the Marxist/Maoist agricultural/industrial worker to \Junger{}'s Overman, to \Junger{}'s later anarch\label{text:notion:anarch1}), there \cbstart{}remains\cbend{} in the person the tendency to resist such structural limitations. It is argued that the use of Web 2.0 technologies, such as social networking and mashups, are a natural response to the creative urge that exists in \cbstart{}the humanity that has\cbend{} not completely given \cbdelete{}over to the Will of the system. That the building of such cultural artefacts are no more than the expression of the desire in the person to communicate and be joined with others of their own species in a way that for them results in a social milieu that is supportive, confirming, open, and in essence, reflects attributes that exist also in human nature. Therefore, Work is a property of the person, and despite efforts to control the person through redefining Work, the person still finds means of expression through Work.\linelabel{notionll177a}

In chapter \ref{chap:production}, I present the argument that through productionism, Work has become the means by which scientific principles are to be applied to humanity, and progressively strips away the beingness that hinders manufacturing processes. That is, the beingness of the human is regarded as a hindrance to the achievement of improved efficiencies in the productionist environment. The result of the application of productionist methods is a dehumanised production environment, populated by technological humanity. However, the technological human seeks to rationalise the worlds that are created as part of the industrial complex and applications classed as Web 2.0 represent a case of where the technological human rationalises its loss of social fabric, and moral and ethical~boundaries.
