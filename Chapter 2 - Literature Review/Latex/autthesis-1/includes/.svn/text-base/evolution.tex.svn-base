\section{Introduction} \label{sec:evolution}
In chapter \ref{chap:socialisation} Work was argued to be spatiotemporally dependent and to possess the property of inertia (resistance to the effort required to effect a change in state),\footnote{See \S\ref{text:socialisation:inertia}, p. \pageref{text:socialisation:inertia}.} thus, the qualities of Work change when effort has effected an alteration to the qualities by which Work is identified. Work is also the amount of effort applied to the material properties of an object to the point where inertia within the object is overcome and change results. Work is the transference of intention, quality, purpose, emotion, and Will of the worker, so that Work exerted will effect change in an object. The effort of the Work exerted by a worker can be observed as the formation of states of emotion in the worker and one of these is the sense of emotional attachment through their Work, thus a person may say that they love their work. 

Work that the technological human exerts is a response to the challenge to gain mastery over the ordering of the standing reserve. The technological human is challenged by modern technology such as Web 2.0 through its ordering power to reveal the standing reserve. The standing reserve that is ordered through Web 2.0 becomes, for the technological human, information, which can be used in the democratic process of deliberation and decision making. Democracy in the technological system is more than just a game of political power brokerage; it becomes a means by which the standing reserve is ordered.

The technological human responds to the challenge by exercising innovation and creativity. The \cbdelete{}reveal\cbdelete{} process\cbdelete{} forces the technological human to negotiate the formation of their ego against the needs of society. There is a constant battle for supremacy in which individual and collective desires rub. The reframing of society in a business model offers the technological human a new challenge as standing reserve. Enframed in Web 2.0, the technological human is challenged to resist ordering as a means of creating an artificial social context, while for those tasked with providing the corporation with efficiencies in labour, resource allocation also seek to resist the artificiality imposed on them as collective units in the technological system's production chain. The technological human, in response, stands apart from the technological system, but then must choose to fulfill the urge to gather itself to itself in an anarchic nihilism or aggregate with other in a social milieu.

In \S\ref{sec:intro.human}, the case is made that the human is a spiritual substance that does not need to be planned and programmed and that society (the collective expression of what it is to be human) naturally aligns itself with positive attributes such as stability, resilience, trust, morality, fidelity, and ethics. Treating the individual human and the society from which it emerges with fear and mistrust is a hang over of productionism described in \S\ref{sec:production:productionism} but Work, as it has been reframed, places socialisation of the workplace as the moral and ethical guide for the beliefs and actions of the workers.\footnote{See \S\ref{sec:socialisation:worker}.} The moral and ethical guide of productionism is fixed in commercial and economic exigencies where, for example, the competitive struggle for scarce resources and the battle to rise up the evolutionary ladder of corporate conquest are promoted as a social good. In this, there is no place for trust, except to those who provide much needed fiscal support. \cbdelete{}Yet, the worker is expected to offer trust in a situation where they are not trusted in return, thus the challenge to the worker is to gain mastery over the standing reserve.

In chapter \ref{chap:evolution}, I argue that mastery for the technological human means that it must come to know itself as participant in the technological system. The technological human must be intelligent about the system so that when turned to human purposes, the system becomes an object of knowledge and the technological human becomes the standing reserve. The technological system is supra-rational\footnote{See \S\ref{text:suprarational}, p. \pageref{text:suprarational}.} and the technological human, as standing reserve, comes to know the effect of changes that have been wrought upon itself and to know intimately, its relationship with the system. As changes are made to the technological system, so those changes are reflected in the standing reserve, which now includes the technological human and all that existed previously. Recognition of change acts as a signal for the technological human to an environment that is subject to constant change and Web 2.0 provides for constant technological change.

In \S\ref{sec:case:intro}, Web 2.0 is described as being unfixed and is in a state of change from which socio-cultural groups (communities) are formed.  In this state of seemingly perpetual change, the technological human transcends productionist barriers that were built between the person and the collective. Through the iterative development of modern technologies, while still in their infancy, a period of social variation with greater levels of democratisation, knowledge sharing, power and influence is evolving.\footnote{See \S\ref{sec:democrat:IS}.} In chapter~\ref{chap:evolution}, it is argued that evolution for the technological human is by way of adaptation to a changing socio-cultural environment, where variation occurs in terms of epigenetic responses to stimuli such that the technological human, is the agent of its own evolution. Building technological artefacts provides the means by which socio-cultural variations occur and these are made manifest as the technological human fulfills its role within the scope of its Work. The direction of evolution is not a fixed trajectory and efforts to contrive outcomes fail, as unforeseen variations cause the technological human to adapt in new and innovative ways.

To bring order to the discussion on the nature of change for the technological human, change is described as a concept in \S\ref{sec:evolution:change}. The argument is presented that there exists for the technological human a state of perpetual change, but by taking a materialist conception of perpetuousity an objective interrogation; the notion of change is undertaken. In \S\ref{sec:evolution:agency}, the technological human is represented as an agency of change, both to itself and to the society of which the person is part. Then in \S\ref{sec:evolution:causes}, I present the argument that the causes that drive the technological human to participate in its own evolution also entail power asymmetries between status levels and access to information. \cbstart{}Also,\cbend{} the desire for security and independence, the social and moral imperative to address economic imbalances, inclusion in decision-making processes, social integration permitting the sense that the person is involved in something greater than themselves, the elevation of the dignity of labour, and the shift of Work towards it becoming an enriching and educative process. Finally, in \S\ref{sec:evolution:Work}, I conclude that drivers that motivate the technological human are related to person's humanity and that effort to limit these through productionism result in disease. Work, for the technological human, is social and benefits passed on to the person must therefore be social in origin.

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:intro}, the anarch is introduced in relation to the classification of people who have been born into an age of advanced communication technologies, the Millennials. In chapter \ref{chap:socialisation}, the anarch is described as the internal response to a productionist environment by building a persona that is agreeable, but disconnected. In chapter \ref{chap:evolution}, the anarch is further described as a by-product of productionism (alongside the technological human) and that it is a natural response to an unnatural (rational) phenomenon.\footnote{\pageref{evoll88}:\ref{evoll88}--\pageref{evoll88a}:\ref{evoll88a}.} A distinction is made between the anarch and technological humanity where the anarch is subject to many of the same forces as technological humanity, but the inner struggle is different.\footnote{\pageref{evoll82}:\ref{evoll82}--\pageref{evoll82a}:\ref{evoll82a}. \pageref{evoll82b}:\ref{evoll82b}--\pageref{evoll82c}:\ref{evoll82c}. \pageref{evoll85}:\ref{evoll85}--\pageref{evoll85a}:\ref{evoll85a}.} Despite that the anarch may be a means of escape from the juggernaut, it has problems of its own. The need to internally reject the technological system also has the effect of rejecting others that are of technological humanity.\footnote{\pageref{evoll94}:\ref{evoll94}--\pageref{evoll94a}:\ref{evoll94a}.} Thus, the anarch experiences solitude. To expel the sensation of aloneness, the anarch seeks confirmation.\footnote{\pageref{evoll94b}:\ref{evoll94b}--\pageref{evoll94c}:\ref{evoll94c}.}}

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:evolution}, the first new argument is that both technology and the technological human are in a state of change. Change in society and the technological system are related to the metaphor of the river: an enduring social artefact used to represent an object that is subject to internal change.\footnote{As the river is a recurrent metaphorical theme, so too is the conception of the cybernetic overlord who has unfettered control over legions of mindless humans. In this context, they serve to represent the armies of technological humans who are subjugated to lives of tedium. The technological human is called upon to make its escape from the cybernetic juggernaut, but that cannot be achieved through onslaught. Escape from the juggernaut must be in its sight, and \Junger{} suggests the means is by adopting and cultivating the persona of the anarch.}\footnote{\pageref{evoll31}:\ref{evoll31}--\pageref{evoll31c}:\ref{evoll31c}. \pageref{evoll74}:\ref{evoll74}--\pageref{evoll74a}:\ref{evoll74a}.} The argument progresses, that change that is caused has material form, but with conditions. That is, change in chapter \ref{chap:evolution} refers to causal temporal change within society.\footnote{\pageref{evoll35}:\ref{evoll35}--\pageref{evoll35c}:\ref{evoll35c}.}}

\ColourTextRed{The second new argument in chapter \ref{chap:evolution} states that there is a distinction between alteration and change in an object. Alteration in an object are those insubstantial variations to its internal form that are distinguishable but do not substantially effect overall variation in the body of the body.\footnote{\pageref{evoll41}:\ref{evoll41}--\pageref{evoll41a}:\ref{evoll41a}. } Change is either the combined substantive effect of multiple alterations, or the result of significant singular or multiple events that have occurred during some period.\footnote{\pageref{evoll41}:\ref{evoll41}--\pageref{evoll41a}:\ref{evoll41a}. \pageref{evoll53}:\ref{evoll53}--\pageref{evoll53a}:\ref{evoll53a}.} In society, events occur that lead to alteration in society, and there are others where the affects are more dramatic.\footnote{\pageref{evoll41b}:\ref{evoll41b}--\pageref{evoll41c}:\ref{evoll41c}.} Changes in technology and society's operations create the conditions for alteration and eventual change.\footnote{\pageref{evoll53}:\ref{evoll53}--\pageref{evoll53a}:\ref{evoll53a}.} Evidence of alteration and change in society exist from the earliest human records. Some periods of significant change are given names and are identified with specific alterations.\footnote{\pageref{evoll58}:\ref{evoll58}--\pageref{evoll58a}:\ref{evoll58a}. } Reflecting on these periods has allowed the construction of comparative contextual frameworks,\footnote{\pageref{evoll61}:\ref{evoll61}--\pageref{evoll61a}:\ref{evoll61a}.} where application of frameworks to other cases provides retrospective analysis of alterations.\footnote{\pageref{evoll63}:\ref{evoll63}--\pageref{evoll63a}:\ref{evoll63a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{Furthering the second argument, I assert that humanity's efforts to construct technological artefacts, for example, the \IT{} artefact, have had the effect of enlarging what is possible.\footnote{\pageref{evoll65}:\ref{evoll65}--\pageref{evoll65a}:\ref{evoll65a}.} That is, humanity is capable of causing evolutionary change in society.\footnote{\pageref{evoll68}:\ref{evoll68}--\pageref{evoll68a}:\ref{evoll68a}.} However, not all change agents act for the benefit of the greater good.\footnote{\pageref{evoll71}:\ref{evoll71}--\pageref{evoll71a}:\ref{evoll71a}.} Planned change, that which is founded on the rationality of ideology, is not natural. Natural change is irrational and evolution is an example. More specifically, the appearance of a natural response to the technological system has been slow because the right combination of conditions and events were required to engender a suitable mass for a small alteration in human behaviour to be manifest as cultural and societal change.\footnote{\pageref{evoll90}:\ref{evoll90}--\pageref{evoll90a}:\ref{evoll90}.}}

\ColourTextRed{Therefore, in the third new argument, I argue that the technological human becomes the agent of change in its own evolution, where drivers for change include the recognition of power asymmetry in social relations, desire for security, satisfaction of social and moral coda, feelings of inclusion and integration, and new opportunities.\footnote{\pageref{evoll99}:\ref{evoll99}--\pageref{evoll99a}:\ref{evoll99a}. \pageref{evoll141}:\ref{evoll141}--\pageref{evoll141}:\ref{evoll141}.} Additionally, technological humanity is aligned to the four causes, in which the technological human is the efficient cause.\footnote{\pageref{evoll111}:\ref{evoll111}--\pageref{evoll111a}:\ref{evoll111a}.} While the form of technological humanity is caused by what it created (the barber's paradox), the substance is no different from natural humanity.\footnote{\pageref{evoll115}:\ref{evoll115}--\pageref{evoll115a}:\ref{evoll115a}.} The appearance of human nature allows it to be described\footnote{\pageref{evoll126b}:\ref{evoll126b}--\pageref{evoll126c}:\ref{evoll126c}} and leads to the argument  that the evolutionary path for humanity is not one that can be led by ideology, thus contrived societies have (almost universally) failed.\footnote{\pageref{evoll129}:\ref{evoll129}--\pageref{evoll129a}:\ref{evoll129a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{Furthermore, through the incorporation of modern communications technologies (in the form of Web 2.0), the appearance of the technological human and indefatigable human nature: the technological enterprise can be defined.\footnote{\pageref{evoll126}:\ref{evoll126}--\pageref{evoll126a}:\ref{evoll126a}. } Within the technological enterprise, the participatively democratic group should need minimal control and government.\footnote{\pageref{evoll129b}:\ref{evoll129b}--\pageref{evoll129c}:\ref{evoll129c}.} This holds true for both civil and commercial groups. Attempts at forcing control emphasise entropy, which leads to unwanted phenomena.\footnote{\pageref{evoll129d}:\ref{evoll129d}--\pageref{evoll129e}:\ref{evoll129e}.} The technological enterprise, instead of being a mono-cultural autocracy, is a more complex but supportive organisation.\footnote{\pageref{evoll134}:\ref{evoll134}--\pageref{evoll134a}:\ref{evoll134a}.} The benefits may be shared by both the enterprise and its employees\footnote{\pageref{evoll137}:\ref{evoll137}--\pageref{evoll137a}:\ref{evoll137a}.}}


\section{What is change?} \label{sec:evolution:change}
\nobreak
\linelabel{evoll31}The technological human's relationship with the technological system appears to represent a state of flux in which both are engaged in seemingly perpetual change,\linelabel{evoll31a} much like the waters of a river that flow, where each time a person steps into the river the waters are different, but the river remains the same river~\cite{Graham2005}. Indeed, a unique river that is named often comprises the water flowing into it from its head waters and down to the river's mouth. \linelabel{evoll31b}Like the river's relationship with its waters, both the technological human and the system appear to be constantly changing, but any changes are in terms of the socio-cultural variance that is acknowledged as society.\linelabel{evoll31c}

\linelabel{evoll35}Change in society that is caused suggests a materialist perception of form, and one is tempted to include society in that notion and refer to it as materialist, however to do so, negates \cbstart{}Peirce's \citeyear{Peirce1992b} pragmatist acceptance of metaphysics.\cbend{} While I do not automatically subscribe to a materialist ideal of society, for example as espoused by Marx, conceptualising change in the outset as an object helps in understanding the causes and effects of change.\linelabel{evoll35a} Generally, when considering questions regarding cause and effect in society, notions of difference or non-identity emerge~\cite{Mortensen2006}, but in any case of measurable difference, there must be some agreed to scale, for example in the physical sciences, velocity is measured as a rate of change of position over a given distance in a given time frame. \linelabel{evoll35b}Such usage of change refers to spatiotemporal variances and since societies tend to occupy the same space over time, the concentration is on temporal change \cbstart{}and\cbend{} is separated into cause and time. A typical discussion on change would also include motion but looking at society as an object shows that it does not display external motion (that it is not seen moving about the place), instead, this discussion refers to change within society. It is the internal structure of society that changes and not the society itself. \linelabel{evoll35c}

\linelabel{evoll38}To interrogate the concept of internal change in society I offer a metaphorical case. Briefly, think of society as though it were a stationary object, like a ball bearing. In a ball bearing there are atoms and sub-atomic particles that are in motion but from the observer's point of view, the ball bearing has a continuous and smooth appearance. Over a short time frame, nothing much seems to change on the surface of the ball bearing, but with the presumption that there is a movement of internal material, because when time is extended the surface of a ball bearing often shows evidence of change as pitting, surface discolouration, and so on. External forces will \cbstart{}affect\cbend{} the ball bearing, such as those imposed by chemical reactions with the atmosphere. These forces serve to trigger internal reactions that are seen as changes, and it is those internal changes within the ball bearing that have a manifest change in the ball's whole structure. \cbstart{}When the internal changes are observable then one perceives there is change.\cbend{} Society is not a ball bearing but from the outside a society appears as a distinct and observable object,\footnote{\cbstart{}Through Symbolic Interactionism, \citeA{Blumer1986} provides the concept for treating material and non-material phenomena as objects. In the pragmatist tradition, even if phenomena are not directly observable, their effects presuppose their existence. If their existence is held to be true, then experiments that include them as phenomena are held to be valid. Therefore, such phenomena may be symbolically regarded objectively and subjectively.\cbend{}} while internally, there are components that are in a constant or perpetual state of change. Eventually, \cbdelete{}change manifests in society \cbdelete{}as something\cbdelete{} different from \cbstart{}before.\cbend{} I hesitate to use the word motion since that relates to the material properties of a substance, and I have recourse to include the metaphysical properties of society since it is the context and the entity of society that undergoes change, thus it may merely be considered a Cambridge change.\footnote{\cbstart{}\citeA{Geach1969} says\cbend{} a Cambridge change is one in which there are changes to the properties of an object while not providing so much that the object itself changes. For example a ball at one time may be red then at another it is not-red, however the ball is still a ball. If a predicate is true of an object $x$ at a time $t$, but not true of $x$ at a later time, then $x$ has undergone a Cambridge change. Under modern science and formal semantics this concept finds little favour.} If change in \cbdelete{}society is metaphysical and internal, then \cbdelete{}some property of society\cbdelete{} has undergone change. \cbdelete{}This represents an alteration to society \cbstart{}and change internally.\cbend{}\linelabel{evoll38a}

\linelabel{evoll41}To effect an alteration is to make something \cbstart{}appear to be\cbend{} different. However, unlike change \cbstart{}that\cbend{} represents a substantive change to the properties of an object so that it is essentially different from what it was previously, an alteration means that variations to the form or character of an object have been effected so that it remains essentially intact.\linelabel{evoll41a} A Cambridge change may be an alteration since time and some property is involved in the variations that have been effected. \linelabel{evoll41b}The gradual evolution of technology within a society that effects variations in behaviour is an alteration to society. A government can \cbstart{}alter\cbend{} the fabric of society by passing legislation to control some aspect of peoples' lives. Tastes in clothing alter according to seasonal trends, regional differences, economic climate, and so on. The election of an electoral party in a democracy that changes the political intent of a government reflects an alteration in the expectations and desires of voters. A revolution to overthrow the leaders of a society and install a new form of government is not an alteration to governance. A nation that is invaded by another in which the invaders impose their version of society on the defeated is not an alteration. The dramatic effect of advanced or new technologies when introduced to a society that has had no experience of such technology previously is not an alteration. Over a long period,\cbdelete{} the culmination of variations to society may lead the observer to conclude that \cbdelete{}society \cbdelete{}has changed. \cbdelete{}The combined effect \cbdelete{}results in the essential character of society being recognisably different to what it was at some earlier point in history.\linelabel{evoll41c}

Aristotle described four causes~\cite{Falcon2008}:\label{text:evolution:causes}
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item A \emph{Material cause} describes the material out of which something is composed. The material cause of a computer \cbstart{}is plastic and metal.\cbend{} It does not refer to action and so it does not mean the pressing of a button to turn the computer on. 
\item \emph{Formal cause} is the arrangement of matter that gives something its form and by that it is recognised. Identification of a thing is through its definition, form, pattern, essence, \cbdelete{}synthesis or archetype. When using this cause, the language relates to the whole of the thing as principles or general laws. In the case of the whole being, the cause of its constituent parts is called whole-part causation. In effect, formal cause is the planned intent \cbstart{}that\cbend{} exists in the mind of the creator, and is used to model the material form. The planned intent is embodied in the form the material takes and so the essence of the form is transferred from the creator to the thing. The information system exists as an artefact\label{text:evolution:artefact} that is definable in the sense that it is a technological object. \citeA{Orlikowski2001} defined the information system as: those material parts and cultural properties that are recognised as having the form of an information system.
\item \emph{Efficient cause} is also called the `primary source.' It is that from which the change, or the ending of the change, first starts. It refers to the effects of agents of change of all kinds, living and non-living, \cbstart{}which\cbend{} are the cause of change, movement, or rest. \cbstart{}That thing\cbend{} sets another thing in motion, or to cause a thing in motion to stop. \citeA{GaneSarson1979} refer to the efficient cause of an information system when they \cbstart{}refer\cbend{} to the `user community' and the `programming community.' 
\item The \emph{final cause} is the purpose of some thing and why \cbstart{}it\cbend{} exists or \cbdelete{}done, thus an action may be purposeful. It \cbstart{}serves some end.\cbend{} It includes psychological causes like volition, need, motivation or motives, rationality, irrationality, ethics, and all those things that give purpose to a person's behaviour. For example, the information system is provided to facilitate Work and the final cause for an information system is the Work that it is designed to facilitate.
\end{inparaenum}

\textls[8]{\linelabel{evoll53}Within the fabric of society, the socio-cultural artefacts of the technological human and the technological system exercise tensions that result in alterations to society itself. \cbstart{}Accumulated alterations are manifest as substantive change when sufficient have occurred.\cbend{} \linelabel{evoll53a}}

\section{Technological humanity as agency} \label{sec:evolution:agency}
\nobreak
\textls[2]{\linelabel{evoll58}Throughout the history of Western society, there are periods of apparent change. \cbstart{}Periods\cbend{} draw reference from technological developments and they have been given names. \cbdelete{}The Enlightenment \cbstart{}was a period when\cbend{} increased \cbstart{}public\cbend{} access to printed works\cbdelete{} \cbstart{}shifted\cbend{} the balance of power away from the\cbdelete{} Church. The Industrial Revolution marked a significant shift in the make-up of societies as regional demand for human labour resources grew. The Machine Age accelerated the effects of industrialisation from the evolution of steam powered machines to the internal combustion engine. \cbstart{}In the current\cbend{} the Information Age, in which computers supposedly release societies from government control and corporate dominance over the retention of information, making} \newpage{}\noindent{}\textls[-5]{information freely available to all, and marking a shift from the end of the industrialisation of society to a new economic model, based on the manipulation of data as a resource. \linelabel{evoll58a}}

\linelabel{evoll61}The description of human history as periods or ages allows a person to create a contextualised framework so that they can compare what they know now with the remnants of what they see from the past. From their comparison, the person may have the opportunity to preserve icons of events and be educated. In essence, this is the purpose of the museum where artefacts are put on display so the person can marvel at the uniqueness and handiwork of their forebears, or perhaps the person may consider the artifice involved and \cbdelete{}attempt at reproducing the artefact. \cbstart{}Alternatively,\cbend{} the person may \cbdelete{}attempt to link psychically and emotionally to the time from whence the artefact was revealed. \linelabel{evoll61a}

\linelabel{evoll63}Society is caused to be in a state of continuous alteration, so that it is only in retrospect that a person can appreciate what those alterations were and what effect they had either at that time, or some time later. Alterations have a cumulative effect on the psyche of the person and on humanity. The effects of alterations on humanity may be localised or generalised.\linelabel{evoll63a} For example, \cbstart{}while\cbend{} the Work that gave rise to ARPANET\footnote{Advanced Research Projects Agency Network} had an intensive effect, it was localised to academic and military circles~\cite{Hauben1994}. \cbdelete{}\cbstart{}Subsequently,\cbend{} the World Wide Web \cbstart{}became\cbend{} a global phenomenon, the release of Web 2.0 applications, such as social networking, caused generalised alterations across\cbdelete{} societies where it is permitted \cbstart{}and\cbend{} where the supporting infrastructure exists~\cite<for example,>{Mathews2010}. 

\linelabel{evoll65}Technology permits greater facility in the human, and \cbdelete{}this\cbdelete{} promotes the human into a greater realm of capability and possibility. The mind of the technological human is not so different from what has always existed except that the technological human \cbstart{}can use\cbend{} technology to reshape itself as standing reserve. The mind is bordered by its own limitations, imposing on experience, no limits~\cite{Lewis1956}. \cbstart{}Drawing from the work of \citeA{Mead1934}, I assert that the\cbend{} mind is shaped by the experiences of the technological human and technology has allowed it to build a form where the socially constructed networks of connections throughout humanity transcend physical, national, political, and ethnic barriers.\cbdelete{} \linelabel{evoll65a}

\textls[-4]{\linelabel{evoll68}Society, as the \cbstart{}product of collected minds, is defined by morals, ethics, politics, geography, status, economics, religion,\cbend{} and climate through social interaction. Where the mind of the technological human is permitted to cross those barriers and enter new territories, then those causes are brought back into society from whence the mind went. \cbdelete{}That causes alteration in both the mind of the technological human, individually, and in \cbdelete{}society.\cbdelete{} Cumulatively, this amounts to change in society. Therefore it is not technology that changes society but the mind of the technological human. The technological human is \cbstart{}the agent of self change and where change is the product of adaptation to external influence then it is regarded as evolution. Therefore, change in a society that was brought into being by the technological human that obtained of external influence is regarded as evolutionary. A technological human such as this is an agent of evolutionary change. \cbend{}\linelabel{evoll68a}}

\linelabel{evoll71}\cbstart{}Not all change is for the good, and not all human agents act for the benefit of society.\cbend{} As an agency, the nihilist technological human weakens permissions that technological causes might effect. It is through the democratic option of choice that the collective Will of technological humanity, mounted to overcome obstacles as it beckons to the future, takes mastery over the standing reserve and thus itself. \cbstart{}Only a collective will can override the nihilist preference.\cbend{} \linelabel{evoll71a}

\linelabel{evoll74}Numerous \cbstart{}commentators have presented views\cbend{} of the future that is bleak and dominated by some cybernetic entity or other. \cbstart{}While\cbend{} the human is represented as one \cbstart{}that\cbend{} is enslaved, \cbstart{}there is always\cbend{} the hero who breaks \cbdelete{}their bonds and escapes into some bright future (for example,\cbdelete{} Cameron, Hurd \&{} Ellison, 1984; Chaplin, 1936; Lang, Pommer, \&{} von Harbou, 1926; Lucas \&{} Copolla, 1998)\nocite{Cameron1984,Chaplin1936,Lang1926,Lucas1998}. The hero overcomes obstacles, particularly \cbstart{}by\cbend{} human qualities that are absent in the cybernetic form. The cybernetic creature resembles the human, often portraying more negative aspects of human nature such as a megalomaniacal desire to gain dominance over the entire industrialised world. \cbstart{}Reflecting the Taylorist and Marxist dreams,\cbend{} the cybernetic form is represented as armies of mindless and subservient humans who exist in a state of totalitarian materialism, stripped of humanity and their souls.\cbdelete{}\linelabel{evoll74a} Opposed to the portrayal of the subservient human is the anarch.\label{text:evolution:anarch} \cbstart{}The anarch is self-determining and while accepting in itself the technological system, it is capable of overcoming the system in itself without seeking to change the system because, by its very nature,\cbend{} the anarch is not of the same mettle.\footnote{\cbstart{}It is by connection to the Judeo-Christian trees of knowledge and life, and with an intimate knowledge of the cybernetic system, the anarch has tasted the forbidden fruit of choice, self-knowledge, and self-determination.\cbend{}} \citeA{Junger1977} talks about the anarch from the first person, referring to himself, saying:

\begin{quotation}
They found no mischief in me. I remained normal, however deeply they probed. \cbdelete{}Also, straight as an arrow. To be sure, normality seldom coincides with straightness. Normalcy is the human constitution; straightness is logical reasoning. With its help, I could answer satisfactorily. In contrast, the human element is at once so general and so intricately encoded that they fail to perceive it, like the air that they breathe. Thus they were unable to penetrate my fundamental structure, which is anarchic.

That sounds complicated, but it is simple, for everyone is anarchic; this is precisely what is normal about us. Of course, the anarch is hemmed in from the first day by father and mother, by state and society. Those are prunings, tappings of the primordial strength, and nobody escapes them. One has to resign oneself. But the anarchic remains, at the very bottom, as a mystery, usually unknown even to its bearer. It can erupt from him as lava, can destroy him, liberate him. Distinctions must be made here: love is anarchic, marriage is not. The warrior is anarchic, the soldier is not. Manslaughter is anarchic, murder is not. Christ is anarchic, Saint Paul is not. Since, of course, the anarchic is normal, it is also present in Saint Paul, and sometimes it erupts mightily from him. Those are not antitheses but degrees. The history of the world is moved by anarchy. In sum: the free human being is anarchic, the anarchist is not.\hfill{}\citeA[p.~41]{Junger1977}
\end{quotation}

The anarch seemingly opposes that other human tendency \cbstart{}\citeA{Tannenbaum1952} refers\cbend{} to: to join together and find strength and purpose in the collective.\cbdelete{} \linelabel{evoll82}The technological human \cbstart{}is part of the system, not separate and distant.\cbend{} The anarch seeks to follow the tenets of being in the world but not part of it, to be seen to participate in achieving the goals of the technological system but in actuality to subvert the appearance of the system in themselves,\linelabel{evoll82a} \cbstart{}as \citeA{Evola2003} says,\cbend{} by retaining their own sense of being; self differentiated and apolitical.\cbdelete{} \linelabel{evoll82b}The anarch is akin to the nihilists but who is not yet convinced of their own superiority. The anarch is a human response to productionism and exists because the \cbstart{}person\cbend{} is lost in the technological system, where absence or non-participation is not noted. The crushing dehumanising effect of productionism leads to a psychology of retreat, as represented in the anarch, in which the person withdraws into themselves, inwardly subverting the manipulative power of the technological system.\linelabel{evoll82c}

\linelabel{evoll85}Societal barriers that affect society also \cbstart{}affect\cbend{} on the anarch. The anarch experiences inner turmoil as the anarch tries to find rational arguments for their engagement with society. The anarch does not reject the technological system in their life but rather the imposition of ordering that acceptance of the system's conventions entails. The only means of escape for the anarch from the conventional is to learn deeply about itself and the roles that must be played in order to be seen to be a participant in the system while at the same time remaining detached. Gaining knowledge of itself as participant means the anarch must be intelligent about the system, which becomes a dangerous game where emotional engagement leads to loss of the anarch's carefully constructed self. Being participant, as is the technological human who is of the standing reserve, differs from the anarch. Instead of rejecting barriers imposed on society, the technological human gathers them with it\cbdelete{} into a socialised collective of ordering power over the system. The natural instinct of the human to be social and to collect into social groups overrides any attempt to create a disjointed rationalisation. In the end, even the anarch \cbstart{}must\cbend{} come to accept \cbstart{}he or she is\cbend{} a participant in the technological system.\linelabel{evoll85a}

\linelabel{evoll88}Without the ordering of the standing reserve, there could be no anarch. That is, the anarch is the by-product of a dystopian productionist system from which the identity of the person of the anarch is forged from the understanding that they are unnaturally ordered.\footnote{See \S\ref{sec:production:dystopia}.} \cbstart{}Extending \citeA{Masaryk1971}, the\cbend{} person who had in them no place for productionism had little recourse than to create in themselves the anarch or to retreat back into nature. Productionist metaphysics is formed of greed and avarice and some found no place in them\cbdelete{} for that amoral code. Where, for the anarch, Work is a series of tasks that must be done but that are relegated to an inconsequential status, then Work represents a rubbing stone that drives the anarch to regard itself as something different and non-conformist. That is, Work provides for the anarch a means by which the person can seek anonymity through non-disclosure of self and motive, and through that non-disclosure, the anarch has the opportunity to construct a self of their choosing. The agreeable self of the anarch is tested every time anonymity is threatened.\linelabel{evoll88a}

\textls[8]{\linelabel{evoll90}It has taken decades of technological advancement and human reaction to it for the human to begin to return\cbdelete{} to what it means to be truly human. What we in society are now witness to with Web 2.0, as systems are integrated and the standing reserve is reordered in unexpected ways, is a natural human response. The human is doing what has always been done, the technological human groups together to do or share things \cbstart{}using\cbend{} technology, in this case with Web 2.0 applications. \cbstart{}\citeA{Dewey1938} reminds us that\cbend{} human nature has not changed in the form of the technological human. Participation in the technological system, through application of the deliberative processes of Web 2.0, provides resolution to questions, doubts, and antagonisms in the corporate environment, and permits the introduction of an autonomous and anarchic reason to Work. A social community is strong and enduring where the membership participates in its own governance.\linelabel{evoll90a}}

\linelabel{evoll94}However, the anarch fails to apprehend that it is part of a social group in which others of its kind seek companionship, empathy, recognition, respect, and those other properties that are regarded as the basis for a moral and ethical good in the person. The anarch does not seek its future \cbstart{}in\cbend{} the lives of those around it and thus, for the anarch,\label{text:evolution:anarch1} evolutionary opportunities are lost\linelabel{evoll94a} because for the human, beingness is confirmed by proximity to others of its kind~\cite{Heidegger1972}. \linelabel{evoll94b}\cbstart{}Instead, the anarch looks for\cbend{} confirmation \cbstart{}in shared\cbend{} behaviours, acts, responses, memories, principles, standards, morals, loves, hates, ideals, dreams, passions, and purposes. The human is caused to be through socialisation, thus the future of the technological human is firmly tied to others of its kind.\linelabel{evoll94c}

\section{Causes of technological and socio-cultural evolution} \label{sec:evolution:causes}
\nobreak
In \S\ref{sec:evolution:causes}, \linelabel{evoll99}I argue that the causes that drive the technological human to participate in its own evolution entail:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
 \item Power asymmetries between status levels and access to information.\footnote{See also \S\ref{sec:democrat:asymetry}.} 
 \item A desire for security and independence.
 \item Social and moral imperative\label{text:evolution:social} to address economic imbalances.
 \item Inclusion in decision-making processes.
 \item Social integration so that the person feels they are involved in something greater than themselves.
 \item Elevation of the dignity of labour.
 \item A shift of Work towards it becoming an enriching and educative process. 
 \end{inparaenum}\linelabel{evoll99a}

\linelabel{evoll111}The technological human is the efficient cause that discloses the material of the information system and then as specific applications of Web 2.0. The information system is what is to be brought into being, caused by the technological human, and in the presence of the system, the technological human is recognised. \cbstart{}\citeA{Zimmerman1990} refers to the technological human as the embodiment of\cbend{} the Gestalt of the worker in the technological age. \cbstart{}The expression of technological humanity,\cbend{} as the efficient cause, is to produce ever more technological devices to satisfy the technological system's Will to Will. The final cause of the technological system is the Gestalt of the technological human, and in that, \cbstart{}technological humanity finds\cbend{}\cbdelete{} its own purpose.\cbdelete{}\linelabel{evoll111a}

\linelabel{evoll115}The form of the technological human is caused by the technology it has created. The substance of the technological human is no different from \cbstart{}a natural\cbend{} human. Like any other human, the technological human needs to be viewed as a unity. The mind and emotions of the technological human adapt to meet the demands of technology, with the result that socio-cultural institutions become more dependent upon technological production. Just as the human is a social animal, so too is the technological human. Under productionism, the technological human is enslaved to the notion of producing more for sake of more production, which has led to conceptions such as the anarch.\label{text:evolution:anarch2} \cbstart{}However,\cbend{} modern technologies incorporating Web 2.0 applications enable the technological human to make alternative responses to productionism by providing facilities through which the technological human can express human traits and incorporate those into its Work.\linelabel{evoll115a}

\linelabel{evoll117}Work is an expression of the social standing of the person. \cbdelete{}Where the enterprise is the place of Work; that is where \cbstart{}the person employs their time.\cbend{}\cbdelete{}\linelabel{evoll117a} The enterprise is a microcosm of society~\cite{Pateman1970} \cbstart{}such that\cbend{} forms of governance \cbdelete{}in \cbdelete{}society are reflected in the enterprise. \cbdelete{}While it may be true that many enterprises are autocratic by nature, \cbdelete{}many governments are too. \cbdelete{}Autocracy is seen where democracy is merely a means \cbstart{}for\cbend{} the voting population\cbdelete{} to decide on who is going to have decision-making power. However, if having the right to vote exercises the power of the person to make decisions \cbstart{}and\cbend{} where there is access to information, \cbstart{}then\cbend{} an educated public is likely to take advantage of this.  \cbdelete{}An uneducated population is less able to make informed choices about who ought to \cbdelete{}make decisions on their behalf. \cbstart{}The\cbend{} choices they make may be made against attributes that \cbstart{}irrelevant\cbend{} to the role \cbstart{}of\cbend{} the selected decision maker.\cbdelete{} An apathetic population may be composed of a largely uneducated mass, but this is required for this form of democracy to be successful, so that the votes of those who do vote will have more impact. An educated population \cbstart{}that is\cbend{} less apathetic and more likely to vote \cbdelete{}makes this kind of democracy no longer viable. If there are too many dissenting voices, then decision making becomes harder to achieve and more complicated means for offering choices are employed.

\linelabel{evoll120}Modern technologies such as Web 2.0 can facilitate democratic processes in an educated society. \cbstart{}Processes are facilitated\cbend{} by providing a means \cbstart{}for the distribution of\cbend{} information,\cbdelete{} a platform on which decision making can be undertaken, forums for deliberation and argument, the means for both small and large scale publishing, and the ordering and reordering of data to reveal new information and create new content. Already, there are instances where Web 2.0 has shaped social contexts and forced alteration in societies. \cbstart{}When\cbend{} changes occur in the macrocosm, \cbdelete{}they occur in the microcosm too, \cbstart{}for example\cbend{} in established enterprises.\linelabel{evoll120a} This has been shown to be the case \cbstart{}at\cbend{} IBM, where Web 2.0 has become a cornerstone in the company's projections. The deliberative power of Web 2.0 is well supported and opportunities are made available for those who have specific experience can mentor newer employees, which lead to an educated population who can make better decisions. 

\linelabel{evoll123}\cbstart{}While dissent within a population may be expressed through Web 2.0 applications.\cbend{} \cbdelete{}In a participatively deliberative democracy, those who do not support dissent also have a voice and \cbstart{}may\cbend{} balance disquiet.\linelabel{evoll123a} BT feared dissenters would gain a platform but their fears were unfounded and instead it was found that the naturally occurring collectivity inherent in the technological human served to create an environment in which decisions were made clearly, succinctly, and of which there was a full record, which might not have been the case otherwise.

\linelabel{evoll126}The inclusion of democratic processes in the enterprise through applications of Web 2.0 technologies gives rise to the technological enterprise. The form of the technological enterprise is the cumulative effects of technological change and its effect on it as a microcosm of society. The technological enterprise is founded upon human nature and is the product of human characteristics.\linelabel{evoll126a} \citeA{Wilson1998} says human nature is a collection of epigenetic rules that comprise patterns of mental development. \linelabel{evoll126b}Cultural phenomena such as rituals are not human nature but the capacity to create them is. The appreciation of art by humans is part of its nature, but pieces of art are not. Apparent automatic responses to stimuli such as a fear of snakes, is part of human nature because fear has \cbdelete{}manifested in the human. Other responses to stimuli such as favour, love, hate, or indifference, just as with fear, represent the passage of characteristics that have developed as successive human generations have evolved. Such variations through the generations represent alterations in the human, and the technological human is representative of a collection of influences that have manifested as societal change. Societal change and evolutionary manifestations are not planned; \cbdelete{}at times \cbstart{}challenging\cbend{} rationalisation although this allows them to be studied empirically.\linelabel{evoll126c}

\linelabel{evoll129}Efforts to contrive societies based on utopian ideologies have been only moderately successful.\linelabel{evoll129a} For example, centrally governed socialist states have found that societies tend to be complex and government from large centralised bureaucracies provide impediments to economic and social reform~\cite{Goodin1995}. \linelabel{evoll129b}\cbstart{}As a\cbend{} liberal view, it is more efficient to allow people to govern themselves within prescribed guidelines. In the same way, efforts to create management contrivances in large enterprises are marginally effective.\linelabel{evoll129c} Global enterprises have had to learn that localised management can pay dividends~\cite<in particular,>{Osegowitsch2008,Dunning2008}.  \linelabel{evoll129d}The technological human as agency\label{text:evolution:agency1} manifests unplanned and unforeseen variations in its nature that are the result of adaptations to a volatile environment, made increasingly unstable with rapid changes in technology. The technological human finds technological solution to problems, which accelerates technological change and this, increases the demand for novel adaptations in the technological human. Such an evolutionary path, if it is to be considered natural, must be allowed to adapt freely to new environmental constraints. Contrived governance serves to distort and restrict possible variations that may emerge when the technological human is faced with a new problem. A naturally forming society has restrictions based on naturally occurring human characteristics, whereas the enforcement of contrivances designed to create a human form forged on a utopian ideal is, \cbstart{}while rational,\cbend{} unnatural. Naturally evolving human characteristics are not subject to great variation over time.\linelabel{evoll129e}

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:evolution:Work}
\nobreak
In \S\ref{sec:evolution:Work}, \linelabel{evoll134}I conclude that, \cbstart{}while\cbend{} the technological enterprise \cbstart{}ought to\cbend{} employ management practices that best suit its needs, \cbdelete{}it \cbstart{}also\cbend{} needs to acknowledge socio-cultural objects formed within technological human contexts. \cbstart{}Where\cbend{} permission is granted for the existence of socio-cultural objects built by collective technological humans, then \cbdelete{}their emergence \cbstart{}may be\cbend{} fostered through the provision of supporting infrastructure.\linelabel{evoll134a} The approach taken by IBM provides an example of the management of socio-cultural objects through their corporate social networking, where it became necessary in order for their large workforce to stay connected and to integrate age-based social strata.

\linelabel{evoll137}The technological enterprise of the future is one that relies heavily on the loyalty of its employees; it requires its employees to make an emotional investment in the success of the technological enterprise. But the expectation of such an investment by employees is potentially weak because, in the technological human there \cbstart{}lays\cbend{} the anarch, the tendency to retreat and keep ones' own counsel, while outwardly working for the benefit of the enterprise. For the technological enterprise, a fundamental requirement is that the socio-cultural artefact that is the collective of technological humans and their shared qualities is the part they play in ordering the standing reserve. While their commitment is to themselves as standing reserve, the technological human may still be attracted by other benefits, such as having the opportunity to express themselves through the social network or participating in the process of ordering.\linelabel{evoll137a}

\linelabel{evoll139}Productionism has shown that monetary reward is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of people. Remuneration is only the medium of exchange that compensates for the time that is given over to Work. It does not compensate for loss of socio-cultural integration, loss of power, but is the distancing of the person from their sense of Dasein. The technological enterprise, through fostering of technologies, is able to offer the infrastructure the technological human can use to build its own social networks, such as those at BT. This then, becomes as valuable as remuneration and provides an opportunity for the employee to invest emotionally in the purposes and intentions of the enterprise.\linelabel{evoll139a}

\linelabel{evoll141}Drivers that motivate the technological human are social in origin,\linelabel{evoll141a} such as the need for security, love, belonging, recognition, and so on, representing its human characteristics~\cite{Maslow1954}. \linelabel{evoll141b}Efforts to restrict \cbstart{}expression\cbend{} or create contrivances fail when unforeseen factors occur and cause the person to take a different route towards resolving mental or emotional disturbances. A driver for the person is to seek peace and the process of resolving problems brings that sense. The absence of peace is sensed as disturbances in the mind and emotions and these are not always rational, thus resolutions to disturbances may not be rational either. For the technological human, many of its fundamental and social needs can be met through modern technologies like Web 2.0, in particular, those related to socio-cultural interactions. Where mental and emotional peace through self-actualisation is the goal, then this has a direct impact on the way that the technological human regards its social network and therefore its Work. It becomes more than a means to monetary reward and incorporates motivating drivers where the technological human is willing to order itself with that goal in mind. \linelabel{evoll141c}

Chapter \ref{chap:semantics}, \cbstart{}is\cbend{} a summary of the main arguments, leading to a formal representation of Work and the Work System. Work, the System, and the Work System are described in natural language \cbstart{}before\cbend{} their representation as a series of semantic statements.
