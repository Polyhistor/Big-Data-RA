\section{Introduction}
\nobreak
Chapter \ref{chap:intro} states the principal concepts that are used throughout the thesis: the premise that underlies this work in \S\ref{sec:intro.premise}. In \S\ref{sec:intro.human}, the human and the person are defined, which leads to the definition of the technological human in \S\ref{sec:intro.technohuman}. In \S\ref{sec:intro.prodWork}, is defined the productionist view of Work, which is coupled with a view of the Work System in \S\ref{sec:intro.WorkSystem}. Finally, in \S\ref{sec:intro.Philosophy}, the philosophical schools that guide this thesis are introduced. To assist the reader \S\ref{sec:intro:roadmap} provides an overview of the thesis and how the discussion proceeds, culminating in the formalised semantic ontology described in \S\ref{sec:semantics:formal}.

\ColourTextRed{The objective of the thesis is to answer the question: \emph{What are the semantics of Work in the Work System?} To answer the question, I have taken the position of a holistic pragmatist philosopher, with the principal authors informing the structure and nature of enquiry: Peirce, Dewey, Quine, and White. Supporting philosophers in the thesis include Heidegger, \Junger{}, Lakatos, Blumer, and James. Influential commentators include Zimmerman, Masaryk, Tannenbaum, and Pateman.\footnote{See also, \pageref{methodll48}:\ref{methodll48}--\pageref{methodll48a}:\ref{methodll48a}.} To address the question, Work has been construed as a property of the human that influences and is influenced by socio-cultural factors. Thus, Work is considered in the context of it as a notion, historically, as a means to production within the industrial complex, and social impacts on and of Work through differing philosophies. Ways that Work may be reconceptualised when influenced by recent trends in technological development are considered. }

\ColourTextRed{Figure \ref{fig:intro:thesisStructure} illustrates the relationship between the overall vision and where the thesis is positioned. The Work System is a case of \is{} theory development that draws from human and natural phenomena. To example and test thought experiments, instantiations have been selected. Instantiations are selected case studies and the \IT{} artefact, Web 2.0.}

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:intro}, I frame the arguments that are presented throughout the thesis. I situate an objective understanding of Work that sees it as both material and immaterial, where the existence of immateriality allows for a subjective interpretation of Work.\footnote{\pageref{ll36}:\ref{ll36}--\pageref{ll36a}:\ref{ll36a}.}\footnote{Abstraction of human relations provides a means for modelling common understandings and behaviours. While this allows for economic use of time and resource, it is that which also creates conditions for practitioners to simply take a nearby model or theory and apply that, instead of searching for the irrational (natural phenomena). See \pageref{ll116}:\ref{ll116}--\pageref{ll116a}:\ref{ll116a}. } An example of a subjective property of the human is culture, in which culture is understood to be a property unique to the human. However, it cannot be said that humanity is a property of culture.\footnote{\pageref{ll42}:\ref{ll42}--\pageref{ll42a}:\ref{ll42a}.}\footnote{Ad hoc approaches to the creation of abstractions become barriers to purposeful or intentional thought. It is when abstractions are investigated that they disclose meaning. The moment of their interaction provides meaning, thus events become abstract objects of knowledge. When abstractions (objects of knowledge) are brought back into the material worlds, they are imbued with new meaning and the person's knowledge of them allows the objects to be controlled. See \pageref{ll123}:\ref{ll123}--\pageref{ll125}:\ref{ll125}.} My assertion that Work is a property of the human (in which technology facilitates Work and that Work has enabled the human to extend the capabilities of technology) has sped humanity along its evolutionary path.\footnote{\pageref{ll48}:\ref{ll48}--\pageref{ll48a}:\ref{ll48a}.} However, while culture and Work are human properties, technology is not.\footnote{\pageref{ll48b}:\ref{ll48b}--\pageref{ll48c}:\ref{ll48c}.}  }

\ColourTextRed{The argument that Work serves as a socio-cultural object that provides a social good is presented, and that as culture is a uniquely human property, then Work is a property of the human.\footnote{Throughout the thesis, a referencing system is applied. The reference points to page number and line number as follows: $\langle \mbox{page number}\rangle : \langle \mbox{line number} \rangle$.}\footnote{\pageref{ll:27}:\ref{ll:27}--\pageref{ll:27a}:\ref{ll:27a}.} To facilitate Work, the human has created technologies and in time, the human has become reliant upon the technologies it created. As dependency has increased, the technologies the human created have begun to dominate the human to the extent that it seemingly no longer displays those other properties that identify humanity.\footnote{See \S\ref{sec:intro.human}.} However, the human is not so easily quashed.\footnote{\pageref{ll64}:\ref{ll64}--\pageref{ll64a}:\ref{ll64a}. } In recent years, humanity appears to be emerging into a new technological form in which it may be able to retake command of technology and further its own ends, rather than those of technology. That is, conceptions of Work and the Work System are largely founded in industrial processes and I argue that, as the human has begun to regain control of its destiny, understandings of Work and Work Systems need to be redefined\footnote{\pageref{ll:30}:\ref{ll:30}--\pageref{ll:30a}:\ref{ll:30a}. \pageref{ll66}:\ref{ll66}--\pageref{ll66a}:\ref{ll66a}.} and that modern technology provides the means for the human to regain its Dasein.\footnote{\pageref{ll33}:\ref{ll33}--\pageref{ll33a}:\ref{ll33a}.}\footnote{Dasein is a term used widely in German philosophy to mean the ``existence'' of something. The word is the compound of Dass-sein, ``that it is.'' Adjacent in meaning to Dasein is Was-sein or ``essence,'' and means ``what it is.'' Both terms relate to a thing, state of affairs, person, or God. It is usually used in reference to living creatures, or at least the implication where it is used is that the thing has a life about it. For \citeA{Heidegger1993book}, Dasein refers to existence in which the thing's Being is disclosed.} }

\ColourTextRed{\textls[4]{However, I argue that the case of success for any person is not guaranteed and is dependent upon the extent and breadth of their experience and education. This provides the basis upon which a person can construe accurate perception. Thus, a precondition of their ability to judge and critically analyse is having the power to choose and the skills associated need to be developed and honed. Therefore, people who are only ever led or told what to think will, when put to the task, tend towards being told, rather than searching for their own answers.}\footnote{\pageref{introll84}:\ref{introll84}--\pageref{ll86a}:\ref{ll86a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{\textls[4]{Finally, technology is positioned as a human means to an end, but humanity has become dependent upon its means to the extent that it appears the human is a technological property. This gives rise to the conception of the technological human. The appearance of technological humanity is presented because of the application of productionist ideology; in the sense that it is the product of external forces and internal adaptations to exigency.\footnote{\pageref{ll:47}:\ref{ll:47}--\pageref{ll:47a}:\ref{ll:47a}.} Subsequently, I shall argue that the human must regain its lost sense of self, but not by fighting against the system that seeks to reframe humanity for its own ends. Rather, that the answer already exists in the qualities that productionism relegates as being irrational and of no account.\footnote{\pageref{ll61}:\ref{ll61}--\pageref{ll61a}:\ref{ll61a}.} As an object of knowledge, nature represents those properties the human aspires to. However, the human has exercised its dominance over nature through science, and as nature has changed, so too has humanity's perceptions of it, thus human changes of perception are reflected in nature, as an object.}\footnote{\pageref{ll89}:\ref{ll89}--\pageref{ll91}:\ref{ll91}. }}



\section{Roadmap} \label{sec:intro:roadmap}
\nobreak
Chapter \ref{chap:intro}, the premise and fundamental concepts that carry throughout the thesis are detailed. Chapter \ref{chap:litrev}, \cbstart{}provides\cbend{} a review of literature\cbdelete{} and\cbdelete{} background for further discussion of the Work System. Chapter \ref{chap:method}, provides an outline of the design of the study and the methodology applied. Chapter \ref{chap:case} details both the case studies that are referenced throughout the study to provide a `real world' grounding of theoretical discussion and an overview of the technological artefact, Web 2.0. Chapter \ref{chap:notion} includes the notion of Work, the place that Work has in the life of the person, and how the person is affected by the need to Work in a productionist world. Chapter \ref{chap:production} then concentrates on the dystopian notion of \cbstart{}productionism\cbend{} as the product of the industrialisation of the West, with an emphasis on how the human has become inculcated into the technological system. The idea that the human has become part of the system is carried forward in\cbdelete{} chapter \ref{chap:democrat}. \cbstart{}The person is one who enters the system powerless, in the face of significant power asymmetries, but is provided with the means of rebalancing those asymmetries with modern technologies (in the form of Web 2.0). \cbend{}

Shifting the balance of power in the enterprise may be seen as a significant step in the management of processes and the redistribution of decision making roles, thus in chapter \ref{chap:socialisation}, Work is referenced as an objective notion, in which the relationship between the worker and Work is reframed. The appearance of the socialisation of Work is represented through a shift in attitude and intention. Dealing with the idea that shifting the power to make decisions through the application of technology entails the question of what the agency of change is whether it is technology, society, industry, or the person. Thus in chapter \ref{chap:evolution}, change as a subjective notion is presented wherein the technological human represents the agent of change both in itself and the worlds it occupies.

In chapter \ref{chap:semantics}, the question is answered. The preceding chapters lay the groundwork so that in chapter \ref{chap:semantics}, a series of semantic statements are presented representing a systematic formal description of Work and the Work System as a formal ontology. Leading to that point the System, Work, and the Work System are described in natural language terms in chapter \ref{chap:conclusion}. \cbstart{}In addition,\cbend{} in chapter \ref{chap:conclusion}, areas of possible research are identified and briefly outlined.

\section{Premise} \label{sec:intro.premise}
\nobreak
\citeA{Dewey1939} says that much of what is regarded as historical is the product of the imaginings of people such that for humanity, philosophy is a journey of imagination into its own prior achievements. The work of the pragmatic philosopher is to differentiate matter and matters of the material from the values and meanings that they impart \cbstart{}because\cbend{} of the interactions, relationships, and connections between them and their participants and observers. As a pragmatist, Dewey would say that philosophy is the gathering up of matters and details of the world into an inclusive whole or a small number of principles so that the philosopher can apprehend truths that may emerge or lay within. So that pragmatically, it is when philosophy is regarded as a serious pursuit\cbstart{}, then\cbend{} it achieves a wisdom that may influence action in the lives of people.

This thesis is a philosophical investigation of the semantics of Work in the Work System. \linelabel{ll:27}Central to the argument is the premise that Work is fundamentally a human expression\footnote{For example, a dog does not do Work because the dog does not engage faculties of conscious determination and mind to order its surroundings. \label{sec:intro:premise:footnote}} and that Work, as a socio-cultural object, serves as a social good through the establishment of relations of various kinds. Throughout history humans have created technologies to facilitate Work, until the last three centuries, when industrialisation of the workplace has created a society that facilitates production, resulting in the destruction of social organisations built up over millennia. Information systems are examples of the application of industrial technologies where `users' are relegated to the status of production units. However, recent developments in computing technologies and the extensions of an increasingly networked world, for example Web 2.0 technologies, now provide an opportunity for the democratisation of the workplace, and for workers to exercise greater power in decision-making processes, and for the re-establishment of non-work related social groups that reflect natural human social organisation. \linelabel{ll:27a}

\textls[4]{Throughout both the Western and Eastern world, populations are witnessing a period of significant societal change that is being facilitated by knowledge and information sharing, increased power and influence at the micro-scale through access to broadcast technologies, and reshaping or creating new world-views by reordering data. \linelabel{ll:30}I argue that the meaning of Work in the Work System is redefined under the shadow of world events. While agreeing with \citeA{Dewey1938}, that human nature itself does not change, I argue also that the roles played by what \citeA{Heidegger1954} termed the technological human and how they organise themselves socially, appears to be undergoing significant shifts as new technologies such as Web 2.0 become increasingly available to \linelabel{ll:30a}populations. }

\textls[4]{\citeA{Dewey1938} says that human beliefs are influenced by many factors and these are provided through social structures, as cultural objects, education, and so on. \linelabel{ll33}I add that modern technologies open doors to perceptions that otherwise may have been shut, and belief patterns that populations were not exposed to previously are adopted.\linelabel{ll33a} \citeA{Barenberg1994} says that the weak and dispossessed find they have a voice and are able to express themselves when their access to authority and information are improved, building a more participative democracy but at the same time challenging existing socio-cultural structures. }

\citeA{Lakatos1970} says that in any field of research,\cbdelete{} terms must be agreed to form a hardened core around which theories can be established, providing a buffer against attack and where weak theories are tested and fail without harming the research itself. As a field of research, Information Systems (\IS{}) can no longer be regarded as a fresh poppy in the domain of scientific research, and the time has passed where \IS{} ought to have built a solid core of theory. There \cbstart{}is\cbend{} a range of theories or methods to which \IS{} researchers often refer.\footnote{\label{text:intro:footnote:theories}For example \citeA{Schenberger2011} list some 74 theories that have their roots in human related activities from sociology, economics, and politics, to computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physics. Of these, adaptive structuration theory, cognitive fit theory, the theory of deferred action, Delone and McLean \IS{} success model, Fit-Viability theory, general deterrence theory, media synchronicity theory, process virtualisation theory, socio-technical theory, task closure theory, task technology fit, technology acceptance model, theory of technology dominance, unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, work systems theory, and yield shift theory of satisfaction claim to have their roots specifically in the field of \IS{}.} \linelabel{ll36}I argue that Work constitutes a core term in \IS{} and that it makes appearance throughout material and immaterial worlds. Thus the semantics of Work and the Work System in \IS{} are presented as a formal description, through a state and event-type reification of temporal logic~\cite{Allen1984}.\linelabel{ll36a}\label{text:intro:temporlogic}

\section{Humanity} \label{sec:intro.human}
\nobreak
The human is said to be a social animal and, unlike other social animals is a member of the genus hominidae that carries the characteristics of superior intelligence, articulate speech, and erect carriage. \citeA{Strawson1959} says the individual human, the person, is a substance that is both physical and mental. \citeA{Ryle1979} says it is a category mistake to make the assertion: that it is the mind that thinks or the body that walks, but that it is the person of the human that both thinks and walks. \citeA{James2007} says it has long been understood that the human has an innate intelligence and a spiritual and soul dimension that sets it apart from the other creatures. It is important to see that the human is a unity and that the human is the embodiment of personality, will, soul, spirit, mind, emotion, intelligence, and so on. Humanity is the essence of the human that carries forward over the whole range of human appearances. A dead human is a corpse and while it looks human, it is absent of those other animating characteristics. A zombie is a corpse that is animated, but lacks humanising characteristics. A cybernetic human\footnote{\emph{Cybernetics} is taken from the Greek \emph{kubern\=e{}t\=e{}s} meaning steersman, which is from \emph{kubernan} to steer, control~\cite{Times2000}.} is animated and attains most of the characteristics of a human but is not a part of humanity. \citeA{Zimmerman1990} draws a  parallel between a cybernetic human and a technological human described by \citeA{Heidegger1954}, in which an outside system's Will governs the technological human.

Gathering together in social groups allows humans to use their collective strengths and overcome obstacles. Humans form socio-cultural groups in which they co-operate with each other and form bonds. Humanity also includes the range of cultures that have become established in human social groups. Culture as a term is broad and often open to disagreement but a culture includes knowledge and values shared by social groups, religions, laws and legal structures, forms of governance, expressions through the arts, attitudes, behaviours, and the various techniques and modes of development and growth of all of these. \linelabel{ll42}A human is not culture but culture is human. Socio-cultural groups that humans form are societies and the socio-cultural group in which a human resides is~its~society. \linelabel{ll42a}

\section{The technological human} \label{sec:intro.technohuman}
\nobreak
Technology as it is understood today is the usage and knowledge of tools, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organisation. The etymological root of technology is found in the Greek \emph{techne} (\begin{greek}t'eknh\end{greek}) and \emph{legein} (\begin{greek}l'egw\end{greek}), which leads to \emph{logos} (\begin{greek}l'ogos\end{greek}), meaning to gather or to assemble. \emph{Techne} means both art and handicraft so technology relates to the disclosure of something and its being revealed. \linelabel{ll48}Technology is used to effect changes on the environment, and having the ability to use technology has enabled the human to advance its evolution.\linelabel{ll48a} It is a characteristic of the human that it uses technology to forward its aims and intentions over the environment and to effect changes on its society~\cite{Winner1986}. \linelabel{ll48b}Technology is not humanity although humanity uses technology as part of its cultural domain.\linelabel{ll48c}

\citeA{Heidegger1954} says the human cannot master the essence of technology. Instead, technological humanity has created a society in which it has developed disciplines designed to create mastery over itself. That is, the purpose of the disciplines \cbstart{}is\cbend{} to ensure that humans, the technological humans, are amenable to the demands of technology in society. \citeA{Lewis1943} agrees, saying that in its quest to gain mastery over nature, humanity forgets what it means to be human and humanity becomes subject to technological domination. \citeA{Toffler1972} sees that technological innovation is occurring at an alarming rate and that this is \cbstart{}transforming\cbend{} the socio-political landscape. His fear is that humanity's ability to evolve its social and cultural practices to cope with changes wrought by technological change is being outpaced.

To address these fears, \citeA{Junger2007} defines a new form of human that \cbstart{}is\cbend{} both hard and courageous\cbstart{}:\cbend{} the overman \cite<influenced by>{Nietzsche1987}. He says the human must embrace technology with a Will being akin to that \cbstart{}who\cbend{} caused primitive humans to be great and powerful. \citeA{Zimmerman1990} says that to embrace technology, it is necessary for humanity to fully surrender to technology's Will to Will and, as the soldier-worker, do whatever is required to \cbstart{}fulfill\cbend{} planetary domination. \cbstart{}Thus is humanity compelled\cbend{} to be the Gestalt of the worker, to produce ever more technological devices to meet its imperative. For \citeauthor{Junger2007}, the soldier-worker \cbstart{}is the Gestalt of the worker and\cbend{} is the highest meaningful reality for the human. The Gestalt of the worker embodies the totality of what a worker may be. The technological human is the expression of the Gestalt of the worker who has embraced technology and surrendered to its Will.

\cbstart{}\linelabel{ll:47}I contend that the technological human is a natural human response to a productionist \cbend{} technological age \cbstart{}where Work, if it is to be engaged with at all,\cbend{} must be meaningful, fulfilling, and if not of benefit to society, then not destructive of it or the environment.\linelabel{ll:47a} \citeA{Junger1977} foresaw the Millennial when he described the `anarch.'\footnote{The anarch is discussed in detail on pp. \pageref{text:evolution:anarch}--\pageref{text:evolution:anarch1}. For further commentary, see pp. \pageref{text:notion:anarch}, \pageref{text:notion:anarch1}, \pageref{text:socialisation:anarch}, and \pageref{text:evolution:anarch2}.} The technological human is well represented by that generation born into the technological age. \cbstart{}Various characterisations have been attributed to those who were born in the latter half of the twentieth century, for example Gen X, Gen Y, and so on. In this thesis one group are selected because this group is the first to have grown up with the Internet.\cbend{} \citeA{Strauss2000} say Millennials are those who are born some time between 1980 and 2000.\label{text:intro:millennial} Millennials are characterised as those who have been doted upon by their parents, whose lives have been structured from birth, and have had exposure to many different types of people. Millennials expect to have their views heard and respected, enjoy a challenge, with the expectation that they will complete them well. They tend towards philanthropy and support valued causes. They do not suffer boredom well and expect to be able to schedule work commitments around those of their lives. They are connected via technology and if there are no local challenges for them then they will search to find a new one. This means Millennials may be viewed as having no work ethic but instead, their ethics are anarchic. Their tendency to move from job to job may suggest an absence of loyalty but loyalty is a quality that must be earned and when it is, then it is fiercely contested. \cbdelete{}

\section{Productionist view of Work} \label{sec:intro.prodWork}
\nobreak
\textls[-2]{A view towards understanding production is \cbstart{}via\cbend{} systematic planning of work \cbstart{}practices\cbend{} that were provided by Scientific Management at the end of the nineteenth century~\cite{Taylor1911}. The Work System was employed as a means of maximising production from the least amount of input \cbstart{}of\cbend{} resources\cbstart{}:\cbend{} \cbdelete{}the human is but one. This effectively stripped the human from its natural state within the workplace~\cite{Tannenbaum1952}. }

\linelabel{ll61}The Work System is rooted in industrial plants, placing information systems that refer to it into a productionist role, where the person is subservient to the system and the machine, whereas \cbstart{}those\cbend{} systems ought to be subservient to human intention and purpose.\cbdelete{} Information systems have emerged from industrialised processes but the evolutionary path of development has been influenced by factors other than those of pure Marxist materialism, economic and industrial theory, and other ideologies. \linelabel{ll61a}

The work of military and academic researchers has created a networked system, providing opportunities for relations to be built between participants, based on more than just economic or production oriented motivations. Human participants are then taking advantage of those opportunities to build a new and more participatively democratic society, of which the workplace is one part. \linelabel{ll64}Despite attempts by organisations and governments to control the emergence of apparent dissension, the voice of the person who will not be quelled is not silenced. Unable to silence their voices, the powerful are obliged to trust the motivations of their people and that, even though they may be self-interested rather than nihilistic, they can act in ways that are of benefit to the organisation or society. Organisations willing to accept the truth of this thus provide greater opportunities for workers to act autonomously.\linelabel{ll64a}

\textls[14]{Autocratic management practices that emerged from productionism are challenged in the twenty-first century in organisations that have adopted modern networked technologies~\cite<for example, >{Tenenbaum2006}. Web 2.0 introduces the opportunity for the organisation to adopt democratic functions such as deliberation and collaboration into decision making processes, and this shifts power asymmetries between management and workers~\cite{Lammers1967,MassaWirth2006,Pateman1970}. \linelabel{ll66}The result being, that perceptions of Work and how Work is understood and undertaken, changes as a result of the changes that have occurred in the working environment. The effects are transitive.\linelabel{ll66a}}

\section{Work System in context} \label{sec:intro.WorkSystem}
\nobreak
\textls[14]{Since its inception, the Work System has had significant effects on those who have had to work in them, from improving how Work is done to comparisons between workers and machines in the area of cybernetics. Over time, the conception of the Work System has changed and in \IS{} publications, the Work System has been referred to periodically since the 1970s, mainly in relation to systems development and design\cbdelete{}.\footnote{\cbstart{}See page \pageref{text:theorieslist}.\cbend{}} In discussions about the advance of technology and its apparent effects on society, Heidegger provides a strong voice~\cite<for example, >{Heidegger1954,Heidegger1972,Heidegger1981}. Countering this is \citeA{Zimmerman1990} in his critique of Heidegger's work and comparisons against other German philosophers such as \Junger{}, Marx, and others. }

\textls[8]{\label{text:intro.Taylor}The term, Work System, stems from Taylor's~\citeyear{Taylor1911} Scientific Management \cbstart{}as\cbend{} activities that can be clearly defined within bounded organisational units. Taylor describes how piece-work can be performed by a typical semi- or unskilled worker whose Work  exists purely for the purposes of generating goods and services for sale or distribution to customers. Taylor sought to improve the efficiency and productivity of work by encouraging the selection, training, and development of workers and the equal division of work between workers and management through the application of scientific principles. The strength of the Scientific Management method was that science could be put to use to increase profit margins without recourse to humanity. While Taylor's stance has since been condemned as callous, \cbstart{}the core principles he proposed exist today. That is,\cbend{} the division of labour and the creation of the assembly line approach for the manufacture of products, and the use of standardised processes and parts to cater for the needs of a mass market through low prices.\cbdelete{} }

The Work System, as Taylor and others have described it, implies a hierarchical structure.\footnote{\citeA{Taylor1911} says: ``This paper was originally prepared for presentation to The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The illustrations chosen are such as, it is believed, will especially appeal to engineers and to managers of industrial and manufacturing establishments, and also quite as much to all of the men who are working in these establishments. It is hoped, however, that it will be clear to other readers that the same principles can be applied with equal force to all social activities: to the management of our homes; the management of our farms; the management of the business of our tradesmen, large and small; of our churches, our philanthropic institutions, our universities, and our governmental departments.''} That in turn, implies a need for an autocratic style of management relying on the creative powers of those who wield power to make decisions for those who exist below in the chain of command. However, \cbstart{}\citeA{Zimmerman1990} says the human has within it the need to express and those expressions can be surprising.\cbend{} This tendency has the potential to provide the organisation with valuable opportunities, but to foster it requires variations to organisational structures and socio-political environments. For example, \citeA{MajchrzakCherbakovIves2009} describe how social networking technologies transcend hierarchies and perceptions of age/experience to promote the development of innovative technologies at IBM while \citeA{Trist2000} discuss in detail how a team-based organisation can be supportive at operational levels.

The flatter organisational structure, through the team-based approach, described by \citeA{Trist2000}, provides an environment in which creative solutions to problems that affect staff directly are found through discussion, experience, and collaboration. This approach creates an internal team hierarchy with a team leader who also acts as an interface with administrative and managerial staff. Analysis of applications of this approach led to the concept of the `socio-technical system,' which comes out from the body of work referred to as `sociotechnical theory.'\footnote{See in particular \citeA{BostromHeinen1979}, \citeA{Cherns1987}, \citeA{MumfordWeir1979}, \citeA{Mumford1983}, and \citeA{Land2000}.} In `sociotechnical theory,' there is a shift in emphasis away from the analysis of an individual's performance in a Work System towards teams or groups providing a strategy for breaking down the traditional hierarchical organisational structure. Such teams have a high level of local awareness and can react flexibly and adaptively. Over time, their experience grows through the completion of additional tasks, so that lessons learned \cbstart{}can\cbend{} be applied to new situations~\cite{Rice1958}. Effective teams in a Work System need little monitoring to produce outputs required of them. \cbstart{}For example, see\cbend{} \citeA{MajchrzakCherbakovIves2009}.

\section{Philosophical approach} \label{sec:intro.Philosophy}
\nobreak
The critical function of philosophy is ``discriminating judgement, careful appraisal, and judgement is appropriately termed criticism wherever the subject-matter of discrimination concerns goods or values''~\cite[p.~260]{Dewey1939}. Criticism is a process in which one may have something at hand and where proximity to an object quite naturally engages the individual in a process of appraisal. At the most superficial level one seeks enjoyment, but through reflection the point at which one engages with the object becomes the point of departure into the conditions and consequences of a value-object~\citeyear{Dewey1939}. A person accepts an object as a representation of an idea, a property, an entity, a material substance,\label{text:intro:substance} or anything else that may be conceived to exist such that an object can be described and defined and therefore becomes available in light of its effect on other objects, and vice versa. The object is perceptibly exterior to the person. Thus, the person may \linelabel{introll84}``consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, [the person] conceive the object of [their] conception to have. Then, [the person's] conception of these effects is the whole of [their] conception of the object''~\cite[p. 293]{Peirce1992a}.\linelabel{introll84a}

\citeA{Strawson1959} says that perception takes place in a spatiotemporal framework. Particular objects can be perceived to exist provided they have a place in a spatiotemporal conceptual scheme. For \citeA{Peirce1992a}, an object must be conceived before perceptions about it can be appreciated. Thus, an object may be located spatiotemporally \cbstart{}with\cbend{} basic object statements and are construed, through those statements, without reference to any other object. \citeA{Strawson1959} \cbstart{}goes on to say\cbend{} that an object must then be relocatable over some period, using the same basic statements and for that to be the case, basic statements must be quantitative. He draws the distinction with qualitative statements by saying they are attributive, meaning they are applied to an object only once it has been described through a basic statement. For example, one may say that a person is wise only because the object of the person has already been identified. Saying the person is wise attributes to that person the quality of wisdom and that can only be the case when an observer perceives that to be the case.

\linelabel{ll86}\textls[12]{Perceptions supply judgement and therefore criticism (which are rooted together, etymologically) with its material and the quality of judgements that ensue are the result of the depth and quality of perception. How one is able to perceive, is dependent upon the breadth and depth of their experience and education. Thus, how well one is able to judge is equally dependent upon the level of their education, what and how much they have experienced of life, and how able they are to perceive of the world that surrounds them. }

Having accurate or correct perception that leads to equally good judgement is difficult to achieve. \cbstart{}There is no one right way to judge: there are right and wrong ways, \cbend{}learned through experience and matured through wide contacts. Correct judgement requires discipline and a rich background, so it is often easier to simply tell people what they should believe than to discriminate and unify. \cbstart{}Moreover, people who have\cbend{} the habit of being told what to do instead of having been taught how to think, rather prefer to be told what to do.\linelabel{ll86a}

For the ancient Greek philosophers, nature did not conform to any particular definition, stating nature exists as a universal and how objects and substances relate to it, defining them and their purposes\cbstart{}~\cite{Peirce1992b}\cbend{}. This gives rise to the pragmatic position that humans are intrinsically part of nature and to know nature is to be intelligent about it and understand it.\cbdelete{} \linelabel{ll89}Then, when nature is turned to human purposes it becomes an object of knowledge, meaning that nature is \cbstart{}irrational.\cbend{} \cbdelete{}It is \cbstart{}irrational\cbend{}\label{text:suprarational} in much the same way that the overman is not a super--man but a representation of human as an ideal, its values, morals, motivations, and that to which the everyday person aspires to, while still firmly fixed in its this-worldliness. But when nature is presented as an object of knowledge the person begins to know of the effects of change that have been wrought upon it, or its relations with it. \cbstart{}As a person's perceptions of nature change, those changes reflected in objects of knowledge.\cbend{}

Extending the metaphor of nature, over time knowledge changes, grows and gathers attachments, like lichens and moss. To be able to change the objects means to also scrape it clean of those impediments and return concentration each time to the agencies that effected the attainment of knowledge originally.\linelabel{ll91} The traditional view that nature is inherently rational, and that it is incumbent upon the human to come to understand that rationality, \citeA{Dewey1939} says, was costly. 

To illustrate the accrual of knowledge, consider a machine that produces ball bearings. When the object of knowledge is representative of a substance such as a machine, then clarity and knowledge of the machine comes when perceptions about the relationships between forms and operations are made when these are related to the work done by it. Such perceptions may be made in isolation, but the machine itself can only be known when these are brought in connection with one another. In the thoughts, motions, and individual parts are the means by which the \cbstart{}elements link:\cbend{} the physical effects of the means are the consequences. The relation of means-consequence points, then, towards the ideal.

The ideal machine exists as a concept only, and efforts to repair or otherwise maintain the machine are attempts to bring it closer to its ideal. Its ideal is the relation between the machine as an object of means and as an object with consequences. The value placed in the machine becomes the standard by which it can perform its designated function. The more accurately its functional relations are defined, the better the engineer is able to find problem areas in the physical form of the machine, or to propose improvements. Thus\cbstart{}, a relationship exists\cbend{} between value and the amount of work a person puts into an endeavour\cbdelete{}. This increased value provides the basis for the accrual of meaning.

Meaning is not something that automatically accrues or comes in-place when an object is first defined. It adds to the object when it comes under the scrutiny of an observer who investigates its possibilities by examining its relations and operations, then the observer comes to know the object better. When ideas are considered from the standpoint of action, then action becomes the core of ideas. As processes of thinking, knowing, action, and experience begin to cycle, meaning is attributed to objects. 

The question arises: what objects of knowledge shall pass as true? \citeA{Dewey1939} identifies four types. 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item Of the most primitive kind are immediate \cbstart{}sense data\cbend{}, observations made from the immediate senses a person possesses; 
\item \cbdelete{}Objects of everyday experience are the concrete things of the world where a person lives and exists. \cbstart{}When\cbend{} referring to common-sense items, it is to these that reference is made.
\item \cbdelete{}Objects of physical science\cbdelete{} are products that have been identified through the application of elaborate techniques and technologies. 
\item \cbdelete{}Mathematical and logical objects\cbdelete{} may never have a physical bearing. They \cbstart{}only only ever remain\cbend{} in the abstract world. 
\end{inparaenum}
In this thesis, the first three are put in place to derive the fourth.

There is a relation that exists between operations and their consequences, defined by the conditions connecting them. Complex conditions result in fuller and richer consequences, with more significant resulting knowledge. This does not mean there is any truth in the results, just that they are more significant. Physical knowledge, immediate sense data, depends on there being fewer conditions, having a narrow and isolated scope, and operations that are precise and technical. While there is no difference in principle between knowledge of the physical world and that of social or cultural affairs, there is a practical difference. Being an object of physical knowledge is equivalent to being an object of operations that ``discriminate definitely fundamental relations of the experienced world from others, and that deal with them in their discriminated character''~\cite[p.~190]{Dewey1939}. Consequential objects of knowledge are not finalities until they are used as societal factors during enquiry into social and cultural phenomena, when they become instrumental. That is, they no longer operate upon the objects and their relations, but instead, they become part of a method for understanding phenomena \cbstart{}that are more complex. \cbend{}

The special results of science find ways to enter the social and physical environment, but this does not equate to them becoming known objects of science. Mathematical or logical objects are determined from a systematic progress of enquiry, in which the metrics of physical properties are collected from \cbstart{}sense data\cbend{}. The formal objects created are the objects of physical science and are known symbolically. It is through the interactions of the symbols that operations are planned and are able to solve problems. For example, physical science has effected significant change in social conditions, which has resulted in an increase in intelligent understanding. \citeA{Flynn2008} says that ``detaching logic from the concrete has made it a powerful instrument for dealing with the hypothetical and without this, much moral argument could not get off the ground.'' Illustrating his point, it was through the spread of the language and categories of science that culminated in the liberation of reason from the concrete.\cbdelete{}

There exist differences between forms of knowledge, which is the difference in the range or fullness with which conditions are addressed in the subject matter concerned. While there are subjects that amaze, such as investigations into sub-atomic interactions, \cbdelete{}much is omitted from the studies conducted. The conclusions and the results that are presented stand in stark clarity when compared to the apparent messiness that surrounds understanding of the human condition, even though more is known about how people conduct their lives. Much that is understood about particle physics is wrapped in layers of selective abstraction. It is through the process of eliminating the superfluous, \cbstart{}the\cbend{} not immediately relevant, that knowledge can be gained and more found, but when the abstraction process is applied to social and cultural objects, then one must also selectively remove distinctively human factors. \emph{\cbstart{}``\cbend{}Artificial simplification or abstraction is a necessary precondition of securing ability to deal with affairs which are complex, in which there are many more variables and where strict isolation destroys the special characteristics of the subject-matter\cbstart{}''\cbend{}}~\cite[p.~207, emphasis is Dewey's]{Dewey1939}.\footnote{\cbstart{}This provides the means by which social and cultural objects are effectively dehumanised and ideologies built, and where extremes of political and social engineering include Scientific Management and Marxist ideologies.\cbend{}}

\linelabel{ll116}In human relations, the use of abstraction may be applied as a means for establishing a common ground or for creating a channel for communication. At the same time that a common ground is created, so too is there a means for building mutual comprehension of experience as it is gained by the individuals interactively engaged. Abstraction is an instance of economy and efficiency involved in intelligent practice. In so saying, one deals first with those things that are effectively handled and then uses the results and what has been learned in the execution of more complex affairs. However, abstraction creates a comfortable illusion in which practitioners become dependent upon the method with the probability that they may short-circuit the process. \linelabel{ll116a}



\section{Conclusion}
\nobreak
\linelabel{ll123}In the world of everyday experience, abstract objects are formed of things that are casual, ad hoc, unregulated by imposed purpose, and are barriers to thought. By treating them as abstractions and generalisations, basic relationships are defined that disclose their meanings when they occur. Treating them as events or changes brought about in a system of relationships, their individualised qualities are disregarded even though they remain intact. Since these qualities are somewhat relegated they are not included during the formation of objects of knowledge. The abstracted objects, representing the loose details in everyday experience but absent of those qualities that identify each instantiation, become the objects of thought. 

When one returns from abstractive thought to everyday experience then qualities are reattached, but with new meaning from the knowledge object and with greater power over one's ability to control their relationships with them. The ability to control relations comes from processes of reflection and as such, reflective knowledge is the only means of regulation.\linelabel{ll125} There is in this process, a word of caution.

\citeA{Dewey1939} says the assumption that knowledge is ubiquitous across modes of experience is an intellectual fallacy, that it is made mockery of by common sense, those qualities that were stripped out during the process of abstraction\cbstart{}:\cbend{} everyday qualitative, practical experience, and recognition of the aesthetic and the moral. \cbstart{}This\cbend{} doctrine \cbdelete{}calls any object of experience that cannot be reduced to the properties of the objects of knowledge merely subjective and phenomenal. But it is through them, the things that are experienced through love, desire, hope, fear, purpose, and the myriad traits that identify the individual, that one can put those abstract objects of knowledge that have the appearance of nothing more than instruments to some practical use. It is through reflection that one can apply intelligent faculties, wherein modes of experience are no different one from another.

In chapter \ref{chap:intro} the premise was presented in \S\ref{sec:intro.premise} with definitions for the following terms: \S\ref{sec:intro.human} the human, \S\ref{sec:intro.technohuman}  the technological human, \S\ref{sec:intro.prodWork} the productionist view of Work, \S\ref{sec:intro.WorkSystem} a view of the Work System, and in \S\ref{sec:intro.Philosophy} the philosophical approach being taken in this thesis. 

In chapter \ref{chap:litrev}, these concepts are applied through a review of \IS{} literature relating to the Work System.
