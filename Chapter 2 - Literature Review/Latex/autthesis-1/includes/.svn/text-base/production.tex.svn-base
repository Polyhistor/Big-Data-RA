\section{Introduction}
\nobreak
In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, the case was presented for the natural occurrence of Work as a property of the person. It was argued that while Work is purposeful directed action, the purposes to which it is applied varies according to the context in which it is found. An economistic conception of Work provides the understanding that Work is the effort required to transform things in a natural or raw state into things that are wanted or desired. The role of Work is social and moral to the extent that the worker must belong to something that is real, purposeful, useful, and creative. \cbdelete{}That suggests the worker is more than an economic unit or human resource to be exploited even though as an object, the person is reduced to little more than a one page description as a role. Work is a means of support for economic gain, a sense of fulfilment, the facilitation of life, and the legitimisation of religious doctrine or some other utopian ideal, it is part of the worker's being, naturally so, intertwining them in the industry of which they are a part. \label{text:production:support}

The industrialisation of the workforce saw the role of the worker reduced to a point that allows for complete redundancy, where the person has become an abstract symbol. The role of the worker is defined by what the person must do how they must behave, what they respond to, and what they must not respond to; the role separated from the beingness of the person, where they are reduced to no more than a job description. The separation of the natural state of the person from its abstracted form, the symbolic worker, prevents engagement in which the person \cbstart{}may respond naturally\cbend{}. Technological advancement has shown the path of development to have no fixed trajectory and thus the enterprise faces disruption when the path of technological development moves into the unknown, such as is the case with Web 2.0. 

In chapter \ref{chap:production}, the part played by `productionist metaphysics' in the evolution of the technological human from Heidegger, \Junger{}, Zimmerman, and Dewey is presented. Productionism is defined in \S\ref{sec:production:productionism}, in which Work that was once seen as the means to disclose a product and production was centred \cbstart{}on\cbend{} the concept that the disclosiveness of technology was\cbdelete{} tied to human existence. \cbdelete{}Work became the means by which scientific principles could be applied in order to strip away the beingness that hindered the manufacturing process, resulting in a dehumanised production environment. By contrast, in \S\ref{sec:production:web2.0} it is shown that modern technology in the age of Web 2.0 and beyond serves to re-link the two by allowing for the beingness of humanity while reaching towards improved production methods, reduced costs, and improved performance measures. This quasi-organic approach to systems design has led to a rapid expansion of new technological methods and it is these that redefine Work in the \IS{} world.

The argument in \S\ref{sec:production:productionism} states that the human has moved away from the conception that Work means to release product from their source, disclosively, to the current view, that to produce is the result of industrial processes. In Zimmerman's conception of productionist metaphysics, a semantic distinction is made between the ancient Greek `production' and `making' and the `production processes' employed in industrial technology that is seen today. To conceive of production as including only those processes employed in an industrial setting, then technological humanity tries to rationalise everything, either through defining for everything a purpose, or its use as an instrument, where its sense of completeness and security is in knowing all exists because it is meant to be. In \S\ref{sec:production:dystopia}, a dystopian reality is described: \cbdelete{}for the technological human, there exists a loss of purpose in which there is a movement away from the disclosiveness of production, and a differentiation is made between what is art that appears through disclosure, and products that are made through an industrial process. The motivation for the remanufacture of artwork appears to differ whether it is called art or the product of an industrialised process, whereas the technological system has moved towards a manifestation of the Will to Will where the technological system strives for ever greater production for its~own~sake.

In \S\ref{sec:production:dystopia}, the movement of the technological system away from the reality of the natural worlds towards that of meeting the needs of an economic exigency creates a dystopian technological world is described. For the person, the technological world has become an abstraction and it is barely perceived for fear that it might overtake \cbdelete{}technological humanity's sense of self and might therefore be lost. As a result, the enhancing of the power of the `system' has become more important than contributing to the well-being of the person, the technological human, who works in the system. Upon the technological human rests the requirement to come to terms with the juggernaut,\footnote{See comment in footnote \ref{text:litrev:juggernaut} on p. \pageref{text:litrev:juggernaut}.} technological humanity created. It is the gathering of momentum in the `system,' the juggernaut that in the end entwines the technological human into the system's purposes and engulfs the human with the Will of the system.

Then in \S\ref{sec:production:dystopiaIS}, in coming to terms with the juggernaut, the technological human incorporates technological developments into its personal and Work life. Humanity is itself subservient to the technological system and this subservience is expressed through all parts of a person's life, and can be extrapolated to incorporate the rest of society. It seems inevitable, in the dystopian view, \cbstart{}which\cbend{} the person must change fundamentally to meet the juggernaut of technological development. However, the question remains, can a person change the nature of their self or the nature the juggernaut to which they are a part? Technological humanity cannot change naturally occurring entities, but when nature proves unsatisfactory for its purposes, the technological human reframes nature so that it at least gives the appearance of correctness even though reframing results in the representation of entities in ways that are obscene. Reframing becomes necessary to align naturally occurring entities with technological humanity's created conception of economic exigency.

The chapter concludes in \S\ref{sec:production:conclusion} by stating that the technological world as an abstraction exists within the minds of those who have established it and that it takes the form of the juggernaut. That the juggernaut is unstoppable, the call is for the technological human to come to terms with it and to adapt to the demands of the technological system as the juggernaut. Adaptation is made possible when the goal is to re-establish human properties that were stripped from the being of humanity as the desired outcome of productionism. Re-establishment of those properties is shown to be achievable \cbstart{}with\cbend{} technology, such as Web 2.0. But the human never be returned to what it was, it is now of a new form of technological human that is reframed to meet the needs of the technological world, discussed in chapters \ref{chap:democrat} and \ref{chap:socialisation}.

\ColourTextRed{The principal argument in chapter \ref{chap:production} is: that productionism is founded upon the rationality of science.\footnote{\pageref{prodll40b}:\ref{prodll40b}--\pageref{prodll40c}:\ref{prodll40c}. \pageref{prodll40}:\ref{prodll40}--\pageref{prodll40a}:\ref{prodll40a}. \pageref{prodll142}:\ref{prodll142}--\pageref{prodll142a}:\ref{prodll142a}.} That is, the transposition of science over nature has seen the conception of production move from the natural creative capacity of the artisan to rational, repetitive industrial processes,\footnote{\pageref{prodll27}:\ref{prodll27}--\pageref{prodll27a}:\ref{prodll27a}.} because much that exists in nature is irrational and therefore of no account. 
This presents a dystopian view of production (here termed productionism) where the scientific method has created a reality for the technological human, in which humanity is bound to the spatiotemporal conditions of the industrial complex.\footnote{\pageref{prodll72}:\ref{prodll72}--\pageref{prodll72a}:\ref{prodll72a}. \pageref{prodll80}:\ref{prodll80}--\pageref{prodll80a}:\ref{prodll80a}.} Further, that the reach of the technological system extends beyond those who maintain it. The system draws in humanity through promises of being logical, rational, and having a purpose.\footnote{\pageref{prodll44}:\ref{prodll44}--\pageref{prodll44a}:\ref{prodll44a}.}  For the worker, the only offer under productionism is a money wage and there is no room for the creative being.\footnote{\pageref{prodll108}:\ref{prodll108}--\pageref{prodll108a}:\ref{prodll108a}).} Additionally, I argue that within the technological system, there is a battle for supremacy, in which opponents represent extremes of political and economic doctrine.\footnote{\pageref{prodll137}:\ref{prodll137}--\pageref{prodll139}:\ref{prodll139}. \pageref{prodll140}:\ref{prodll140}--\pageref{prodll140a}:\ref{prodll140a}.} Each argues for a preferred means of recovery of personal Dasein for technological humanity, but neither will achieve what they claim because they are caught up in the technological system and they all represent the system's aims. }

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:intro}, it is argued that material notions of Work must be presented objectively and subjectively in order to address the material and metaphysical. In chapter \ref{chap:litrev}, the argument is extended to include the abstraction of naturally occurring phenomena. Abstraction of the material and disassociation from the metaphysical has facilitated the establishment of the technological system. Thus, abstraction permits the decontextualisation of naturally occurring phenomena, for example, in chapter \ref{chap:production} I argue that the scientific method, when applied to the industrial plant, has helped create a technological human that is ignorant of their own context.\footnote{\pageref{prodll55}:\ref{prodll55}--\pageref{prodll55a}:\ref{prodll55a}.} However, for the person to make sense of the rationality of the technological system,  the person must be able to view the system objectively.\footnote{\pageref{prodll47}:\ref{prodll47}--\pageref{prodll47a}:\ref{prodll47a}.} To do so entails a rationale for objective knowledge of the technological system, where humanity is presented as a means for prediction.\footnote{\pageref{prodll50}:\ref{prodll50}--\pageref{prodll50a}:\ref{prodll50a}. }} 

\ColourTextRed{The conception of mechanism, presented in chapter \ref{chap:notion}, allows for the observation and prediction of natural phenomena, but mechanism is very complex and seemingly irrational. In chapter \ref{chap:production}, I argue that the process of scientific rationalisation (as productionism) enables natural phenomena to be released from the impedimenta of irrationality and absence of purpose and logic. As abstract objects of knowledge, they can be applied at will\footnote{\pageref{prodll98}:\ref{prodll98}--\pageref{prodll98a}:\ref{prodll98a}. } and objects that do not conform to the requirements of the system are reframed and made to fit.\footnote{\pageref{prodll102}:\ref{prodll102}--\pageref{prodll102a}:\ref{prodll102a}. \pageref{prodll102b}:\ref{prodll102b}--\pageref{prodll102c}:\ref{prodll102c}.}} 

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:litrev}, the juggernaut represents the technological system (the accumulation of humanity and technology) that progresses inexorably forward. In chapter \ref{chap:production}, the technological person has no recourse, when disconnected from localised expressions and entities, but to adopt those norms that are provided by the juggernaut.\footnote{\pageref{prodll77}:\ref{prodll77}--\pageref{prodll77a}:\ref{prodll77a}. \pageref{prodll157}:\ref{prodll157}--\pageref{prodll157a}:\ref{prodll157a}.} The juggernaut summons all of humanity to change and meet its demands: that change must occur, so that all is made rational and that which is natural is fully exposed under the light of scientific review. Once exposed, what is left of the natural human is processed, homogenised and synthesised, then taken up by the system, ready to be put to Work.\footnote{\pageref{prodll94}:\ref{prodll94}--\pageref{prodll94a}:\ref{prodll94a}.} 
The technological human is inveigled into assimilation in the juggernaut with promises of ease and leisure and the means to obtain such things.\footnote{\pageref{prodll90}:\ref{prodll90}--\pageref{prodll90a}:\ref{prodll90a}.} The provision of the means to attract and trap technological humanity has spawned a massive entertainment industry. However, in the dystopian view, the entertainment industry offers these distractions as a panacea against the pain of having to sacrifice all of oneself that is natural. The juggernaut incorporates humanity's intelligence (both the function and the capacity to know).\footnote{\pageref{prodll125}:\ref{prodll125}--\pageref{prodll125a}:\ref{prodll125a}.} It seems inevitable that the technological human must finally succumb and be whatever it is that the juggernaut wants, at the time it is wanted; even allowing the technological system to reframe humanity's moral and ethical coda,\footnote{\pageref{prodll125b}:\ref{prodll125b}--\pageref{prodll125c}:\ref{prodll125c}} so that the worker welcomes the opportunity to be regarded merely as an object or data.\footnote{\pageref{prodll127}:\ref{prodll127}--\pageref{prodll127a}:\ref{prodll127a}.}}

\newpage{}\ColourTextRed{In a parallel argument, in chapter \ref{chap:production}, I assert that Heidegger's technological human is largely a product of his own being. His discussion reflects The Fall of Man: an archaic analogy that tells of the eponymous ancestor and his fall from grace (whilst not a state of perfection, certainly in receipt of divine gift). Heidegger's technological human is weak, troubled, and subject to iniquities that it created (as a consequence of its choice to live outside grace).\footnote{\pageref{prodll27b}:\ref{prodll27b}--\pageref{prodll27c}:\ref{prodll27c}. \pageref{prodll30}:\ref{prodll30}--\pageref{prodll30a}:\ref{prodll30a}.}\footnote{The technological human has no options except those offered by the technological system, where the system provides completeness and security for the technological human.} 
However, while I accept that technological humanity is a by-product of the technological system and that humanity has been reframed and objectified for efficiency and convenience.\footnote{\pageref{prodll32}:\ref{prodll32}--\pageref{prodll32a}:\ref{prodll32a}. \pageref{prodll32b}:\ref{prodll32b}--\pageref{prodll32c}:\ref{prodll32c}. } 
I do not accept that all that is human has been stripped away during its objectification. The argument that the technological human is left only with its rationality but not what is natural, precludes that technological humanity may regain its sense of self and denies that the technological human can address their latent Dasein.\footnote{\pageref{prodll58}:\ref{prodll58}--\pageref{prodll58a}:\ref{prodll58a}. \pageref{prodll132}:\ref{prodll132}--\pageref{prodll132a}:\ref{prodll132a}. \pageref{prodll152b}:\ref{prodll152b}--\pageref{prodll152c}:\ref{prodll152c}. } Humanity demonstrates a seemingly inexhaustible scope to adjust to the demands placed upon it.\footnote{\pageref{prodll65}:\ref{prodll65}--\pageref{prodll65a}:\ref{prodll65a}. \pageref{prodll65b}:\ref{prodll65b}--\pageref{prodll65c}:\ref{prodll65c}. \pageref{prodll106}:\ref{prodll106}--\pageref{prodll106a}:\ref{prodll106a}.} }

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, it is stated that objectivity requires observer status. In chapter \ref{chap:production}, the conception is extended, such that observer status entails being able to separate technological humanity from the person. Separation requires the person to acknowledge the essence of each and to reject one. The person must accept that the technological system was first a product of its own making, that the technological human was thus a by-product of the technological system, and that the essence of humanity still resides within the person. Thus, separation is essentially pragmatic: the person must accept the reality of their technological and naturally occurring human self.\footnote{\pageref{prodll47b}:\ref{prodll47b}--\pageref{prodll47c}:\ref{prodll47c}.}}

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:litrev}, the barber's paradox is presented. In chapter \ref{chap:production}, the paradox is readdressed: that the human calling is to be human. That is, the calling summons the person to recognise their plight, but head-on confrontation with the juggernaut leads only to counter forces that produce undesirable results. Instead, the technological human must accept they are no less part of the system and to attempt to force the juggernaut back means trying to force themselves back: the paradox would see the human seeking to gain mastery over the technological system, which is itself.\footnote{\pageref{prodll161}:\ref{prodll161}--\pageref{prodll161a}:\ref{prodll161a}.} To break thee paradox, humanity needs to acknowledge that the ways and means for humanity to regain its Dasein already exists within.\footnote{\pageref{prodll161b}:\ref{prodll161b}--\pageref{prodll161c}:\ref{prodll161c}.} What is required is for the human to play its part and reconnection to its Dasein.\footnote{\pageref{prodll169}:\ref{prodll169}--\pageref{prodll169a}:\ref{prodll169a}.}}

\ColourTextRed{In chapter \ref{chap:notion}, security is presented as a resistor to change in the enterprise as one factor that leads systems toward entropy.\footnote{Note that the real threat to the enterprise in a Web 2.0 world comes not from those it employs; the threat comes from the enterprise's entropic nature. \pageref{prodll167}:\ref{prodll167}--\pageref{prodll167a}:\ref{prodll167a}.} In chapter \ref{chap:production}, security is presented as a reason for much that humanity does. For example, in the absence of community and extended family ties, the technological human has had to create its own communities in unions or through the application of technology and in this instance, Web 2.0.\footnote{\pageref{prodll145}:\ref{prodll145}--\pageref{prodll145a}:\ref{prodll145a},  \pageref{prodll148}:\ref{prodll148}--\pageref{prodll148a}:\ref{prodll148a}.\pageref{prodll152}:\ref{prodll152}--\pageref{prodll152a}:\ref{prodll152a}.} }

\ColourTextRed{Therefore, the first new argument in chapter \ref{chap:production} is: that the human property of social connection resists efforts at eradication; despite that the technological system has attempted to strip from the technological human, its connection to what is considered natural.\footnote{\pageref{prodll110}:\ref{prodll110}--\pageref{prodll121}:\ref{prodll121}.} For humanity, strength may be found in connection. The juggernaut broke apart communities, weakening the people, making them malleable and ready for alteration in preparation to play their part in the technological system. Within a few short generations, all knowledge and connection to history was gone.\footnote{\pageref{prodll132b}:\ref{prodll132b}--\pageref{prodll132c}:\ref{prodll132c}.} However, catering for humanity's irrational need to maintain connections, communication technologies fulfill social functions that the displacement from local communities made almost impossible,\newpage{}\noindent{}even though the technological system takes that as an opportunity to reframe communication by turning it to a means of production.\footnote{\pageref{prodll122}:\ref{prodll122}--\pageref{prodll121}:\ref{prodll121}.} }

\ColourTextRed{Consequently, in chapter \ref{chap:production}, the second new argument states: while Web 2.0 provides a means for technological humanity to regain aspects of human expression that were seemingly lost, regaining them must still be achieved within the technological system.\footnote{\pageref{prodll157b}:\ref{prodll157b}--\pageref{prodll157c}:\ref{prodll157c}.} For example, to regain human expression, effective communication must be conducted through channels that conform to those of the technological system\footnote{\pageref{prodll157d}:\ref{prodll157d}--\pageref{prodll157e}:\ref{prodll157e}.}}



\section{Productionist metaphysics} \label{sec:production:productionism}
\nobreak
\linelabel{prodll27}Productionist metaphysics is the semantic distinction made between the ancient Greek `production' and `making,' and `production processes' employed in industrial technology in use today.\linelabel{prodll27a} \citeA{Zimmerman1990} questions the `being' of humanity where, for the ancient Greeks, `to be' meant that something was produced. \linelabel{prodll27b}Heidegger's beliefs, common for his time, are based on the ideal of the Fall of Man \cbstart{}and a reaction against prevailing Judeo-Christian attitudes towards the beneficence of being put to Work.\cbend{}\footnote{\citeA{Derrida1978} says that Heidegger failed to deconstruct the idea of a primordial epoch in which there was an immediate relationship between a primordial being and the human recipient. } \cbdelete{}The conception that the human condition has moved inexorably from a point of purity (which reached its zenith with the ancient Greek philosophers),  to a lesser state of being (represented by the nihilism\footnote{Nihilism is defined as ``apart from my body there is nothing''~\protect\cite[p.~42]{Masaryk1971}.\label{text:production:nihilism}}  exhibited in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries), and where modernity is the final stage of appearance for the West.\linelabel{prodll27c} For the early Greeks, the conception of producing something meant `releasing' or `freeing' from where the essential form of an object had been locked up, so that the object could manifest. That production itself was primarily an instrument or some means to attain some human \cbdelete{}end. 

For Heidegger, \cbdelete{}the destructive aspect of modern technology is directly related to the constriction of human Dasein's\cbdelete{} capacity for genuine caring.\footnote{\cbstart{}Where caring is based in the beingness of the person, then what is offered carries the person's naturally occurring entities, such as warmth.\cbend{}}  \linelabel{prodll30}Alienation from this capacity is the worst kind of dehumanisation and leads to the most terrible crimes against humans and non-humans alike.\linelabel{prodll30a} \citeA{Tannenbaum1952} and \citeA{Masaryk1971} both support this view when they contend that throughout the industrialisation of the West, it is the separation of workers from their communities that has caused the separation of the worker from their social and moral basis, and it is this that provides\cbdelete{} conditions for violence, insurrection, and discord. A rational observer may note similar movements in large parts of Asia and the Middle East that are undergoing industrialisation and~revolution.

\linelabel{prodll32}\cbstart{}Humanity today,\cbend{} the worker, is a technological human that works for a money wage instead of seeking to provide for and facilitating life's essentials~\cite{Tannenbaum1952}. The technological human has Work as a predominant property of their life such that they have become separated from their creative being. The technological human is the by-product of the production process, whether reference is made to the displaced person who washes up on the shores of the industrial complex or Heidegger's artist.\linelabel{prodll32a}  \citeA{Zimmerman1990} thus brings into question the purpose for which products are manufactured or that art is brought into being by the artist. He says that it is a feature of technological humanity that it tries to rationalise everything either through defining for everything a purpose or its use as an instrument. ``Talk of producing as a `freeing' or as a `letting-be' makes no sense. Instead, to make something means to \emph{cause} it to happen, to \emph{will} that it come forth, in order to serve some purpose within the technological system''~\citeyear[p.~235]{Zimmerman1990}. \linelabel{prodll32b}While for technological humanity, there is a sense of completeness and security in knowing that all exists because it is meant to be, this masks a purposelessness in at least two respects:\linelabel{prodll32c} 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item In Heidegger's view, the technological system has left behind the purposiveness characteristic of merely \emph{human} projects. As the manifestation of the Will to Will, the technological system strives for ever greater production for its own sake.
\item The motivation for the remanufacture of artwork appears to differ whether it is called art, or the product of an industrialised process. \citeauthor{Zimmerman1990} suggests that the artist is not motivated by the dollar value of their work, and often master works reach their greatest value long after the death of the artist, and the monetary value of artwork is incidental to its being.
\end{inparaenum}

\linelabel{prodll40}Artwork defies reason, if that reason is established through the lens of productionist metaphysics.\linelabel{prodll40a} \citeA{Zimmerman1990} argues that there is no `reason' why things `are' at all in the same way that Dewey says that nature simply exists. \linelabel{prodll40b}\cbstart{}That is, productionist artificiality is rational. However,\cbend{} the effort expended to produce content for social networks, wikis, blogs, and other social media is neither rational nor irrational, it is \cbstart{}irrational\cbend{} and content is created for no other purpose than to satisfy the desire to create content. These are \cbstart{}claimed to be the\cbend{} nihilistic expressions of a culture in love with its own posturing and self worth, in which the technological human's urge to create is momentarily met through the trill of comment rather than the soul satisfaction of bringing forth. \cbstart{}Creating is not rational because ultimately, creating has no purpose.\cbend{} But this view shrieks with the voices of millions who scream that surely what they are engaged in must be there for a purpose, surely there exists a reason why they spend so much of their time engaged in productionist activities, that their lives have not become so meaningless, that it has even extended beyond the realms of the rational.\linelabel{prodll40c} So ``to overcome our terror and awe in the sheer presencing of things, we make up stories, myths, fables, and scientific theories to `explain' what and why and how things are. Productionist metaphysics constitutes the `story' told by Western man to explain --- and thereby control --- the cosmos''~\citeyear[p.~235]{Zimmerman1990}. 

\linelabel{prodll44}For the human, the technological world is an abstraction, barely perceived for fear that it might overtake one's sense of self, that the vestiges of its self might be lost. Such that in the technological age, it seems that no one is in control of the `system.' That there is no \cbstart{}apparent\cbend{} purpose and that enhancing the power of the `system' has become more important than contributing to the well-being of the \cbstart{}person.\cbend{} Technical innovation and industrial development have\cbdelete{} `logic' and a `purpose' that extends \cbstart{}beyond the reach of the person.\cbend{}\linelabel{prodll44a} The acceptance of the industrialisation, first of the West and then of the rest of the world, has replaced traditional values with largely economic or utilitarian considerations which are blind to personal, social, religious, and environmental concerns~\cite{Tannenbaum1952}. The likely consequence for the global technological impulse is dystopian, not utopian~\cite{Zimmerman1990}.

\linelabel{prodll47}To make sense of the \cbdelete{}rational, first see that it is not the human that is in control and secondly, \Junger{} says, the human chooses to give in to the `system' and accept that it is part of it. The human must accept that the system's destiny is intertwined with its own, that it is as an essentially pragmatic and natural phenomenon.\linelabel{prodll47a} \citeA{Dewey1939} tells us, in addressing the establishment of the pre-industrial economic environment, and taken from the standpoint that it is the inevitable outcome of humans living within nature, \cbstart{}that\cbend{} commerce formed in large part through the interconnectedness of the natural formation of waterways. The phenomena of commercial use effected changes in natural conditions. People engaged in commerce held that it was necessary to change the environment in order to conduct their commercial activities and so they built harbours, docks, warehouses, factories, more efficient transportation mechanisms such as the steam engine, and while going about their business, modes of interaction changed too. For these people, their organs, instrumentalities, and operations of knowing existed within nature, not outside of it. \label{text:production:object}\linelabel{prodll47b}The objective result is that when incremental changes were executed, they also changed what previously existed, and for them, the object of their knowledge was a constructed, existentially produced object. \linelabel{prodll47c}

Out of the considerations discussed, from \citeA{Dewey1939} comes the viewpoint that people are intrinsically part of nature. His view, from the pragmatic position that nature does not conform to any particular definition: that nature exists. \linelabel{prodll50}To come to know nature is to be intelligent about it and understand it, so that when turned to human purposes, nature becomes an object of knowledge. This discloses the irrational property of nature as an object of knowledge. As an object, the person learns \cbdelete{}the effect of changes that have been wrought upon their self and nature or the relations they have with nature. Thus as changes are made to nature, so those changes are reflected in objects of knowledge.\linelabel{prodll50a}

\linelabel{prodll53}That objects of knowledge can be changed\cbdelete{} runs counter to the Greek ideal that knowledge is perfect, that it holds in itself something that is complete and without change. Such unchanging truisms can only be a reminder of what people have always done, as far back in time that recall is permitted. Over time, knowledge changes, grows and gathers attachments. Change means to strip away that which is known of an object and to replace that with what is now known.\linelabel{prodll53a}\footnote{See discussion on change in \S\ref{sec:evolution:change}, on page \pageref{sec:evolution:change}.}

\linelabel{prodll55}The scientific researcher applies what they know of natural objects they are testing in order to learn more about them. The process is logical and rational. Through the application of Scientific Management principles to the manufacturing process, the process worker applies similar steps, albeit absent of either the intelligence about what it is they are doing, or maintenance of the context in which they are doing it. It is from scientific research that industrial processes originate, \cbstart{}transformations mapped\cbend{}, waste eliminated, and conditions made manifest so that production may commence.\linelabel{prodll55a} To that end, \citeA{Dewey1939} says that the artificial simplification or abstraction that is a necessary precondition of the production process is complex. To achieve it destroys those special characteristics that identify an object as unique. \cbstart{}Problems arise when abstractive processes are applied to social and moral objects.\cbend{}

\citeauthor{Dewey1939} distinguishes between methods of operation that affect and effect physical, social, and moral objects, and refers to them as kinds of reality. \linelabel{prodll58}In its efforts to create a rational reality, the technological human has stripped away and destroyed those special characteristics that denote humanity. When that which makes sense for us as humans, are naturally forming human behavioural characteristics \cbstart{}(the irrational), then the created reality of the technological human is rational.\cbend{} This then is the call that rests upon technological human; to come to terms with the \cbstart{}paradox it has created within~the~juggernaut.\cbend{}\linelabel{prodll58a}

\citeA{Zimmerman1990} says that Heidegger and \Junger{} have similar views on technology, that ``it could not be understood in terms of social, political, or economic categories; instead, the socio-economic structures of modernity, including great industries and mechanical warfare, were the empirical manifestations of that which transcends the causal-material realm''~\citeyear[p.~46]{Zimmerman1990}. For \Junger{}, the appearance of modern technology is the latest manifestation of the Will to Power, and the essence of technology is that humanity has become the primary instrument required to carry out this latest phase rather than its mechanised or technological state. Heidegger maintains a variation of this when, \citeauthor{Zimmerman1990} says, he concluded\cbdelete{} ``the essence of technology was the disclosure of all entities as standing-reserve for enhancing the sheer Will to Will''~\citeyear[p.~46]{Zimmerman1990}. Where art is produced, in the Greek sense, and thus the being of an entity through its production is disclosed, then technology too is a mode of disclosure driven by the Will to Will, that Will which exercises its will upon itself for the sake of itself, for no other purpose than its own further expansion. Such expressions of Will are the gathering of momentum in the `system,' the juggernaut, \cbstart{}which\cbend{} in the end, entwines the human into its purposes and engulfs it with its own Will.

\citeA{Toffler1972} \cbstart{}mirrors Heidegger's \cbstart{}concerns about\cbend{} technological development and its effect.\cbend{} In \emph{Future Shock}, he describes the possible impact of technological innovation where the effects of change are occurring at an alarming rate and that this is transforming the socio-political landscape in dizzying and even dangerous ways. He posed the question: \cbdelete{}how can it be that for existing institutions their social practices, values and expectations can keep pace with increases in the development of new devices and systems? Heidegger says that innovations have often been depicted as labour saving, giving the consumer more time for leisure, for example. Instead, the result is that the time made available for leisure is consumed by the need to make money to pay for more labour saving devices. Another issue Heidegger raises is that innovations are often portrayed as solving problems when instead they give rise to new and usually unforeseen problems that may prove to be more damaging than those they were intended to resolve \cbstart{}are.\cbend{}

\linelabel{prodll65}In the more than two decades since \citeA{Toffler1972}, it has become apparent that changes in society have occurred and whether or not these are the result of technological advances, it appears that users of technology aren't as concerned about such things as \citeauthor{Toffler1972} thought they ought to be. Instead, the technological human has incorporated technological developments into its personal and Work life, crossing barriers with the expectation that the person ought to be able to use the same technologies that are available, in all aspects of the person's life~\cite{MajchrzakCherbakovIves2009}.\linelabel{prodll65a} \linelabel{prodll65b}The person almost seems to appear to have an inexhaustible scope for expansion since they became the domesticated technological human. From the time that humanity had a direct a relationship with nature to now, when the technological \cbdelete{}human exists \cbstart{}as an abstraction,\cbend{} the technological human has become malleable, able to be bent to the system's Will, with purposes applied as befits the occasion.\linelabel{prodll65c}

\section{Dystopia} \label{sec:production:dystopia}
\nobreak
\textls[-12]{\citeA{Zimmerman1990} says the likely consequence of the global technological impulse is dystopian. The view of the world through productionist metaphysics shows that motivations for work are driven by external factors and the rewards are limited. Industrialisation}\newpage{}\noindent{}on a global scale replaces traditional values with largely economic or utilitarian considerations, blind to personal, social, religious, and environmental~concerns. 

\linelabel{prodll72}The promoters of Scientific Management principles reframed conceptions of space and time: \cbstart{}they\cbend{} created a reality that is defined as nothing but the quantity of working.\linelabel{prodll72a} Just as the system is driven by the Will to Will; so\cbdelete{} has Work become work for the sake of more work. \citeA{Zimmerman1990} discusses the functionalisation of time and work and the binding of the worker to the time clock in an industrial plant. Through the principles espoused by \citeA{Taylor1911}, work in industrial plants is organised according to functional processes and workers are either slotted into a production line, engaging in repetitive processes, or organised into production units. The worker, who is entirely expendable, is reduced to an element in a production unit. In an obscene fractal Mandelbrot Set, the unit is matched to a chain of production units in the plant, the plant matched to other plants for the company, the company matched to others for the corporation with the result; \cbdelete{}Work\cbdelete{} is reduced and degraded. \cbstart{}There is no difference in function, between worker and machine.\cbend{} 

In the materialist philosophy of \citeA{Marx1998}, machines are considered as no more than what they are, inanimate objects, \cbstart{}and\cbend{} the complex means of production created to fulfil the goals of the capitalist system. For them, the technological means for production is not of itself degrading of the worker; so changing the ownership of machines from the capitalist bosses to the workers ought to create propitious conditions for the development of authentic social relations of production. Contrary to \citeauthor{Marx1998}, \citeA{Heidegger1981} argues that degradation is not the result of any particular economic system, the same degraded status of workers can be observed in both capitalist and communist economies, but that it is a systemic result of production in the technological era. 

\citeA{Heidegger1981} agrees with \citeA{Marx1998} on the point that it is important to view machines as no more than what they are, that they are not autonomous. \cbstart{}However,\cbend{} Machines, a class of entity that goes beyond any single instance, are no longer owned by any person or socio-political class. Humanity is itself subservient to the technological system and this is expressed through all parts of a person's life, and can be extrapolated to incorporate the rest of society. \citeA{Zimmerman1990} singles out language to show how it has become an instrument serving the universal production process. Local dialects are becoming overrun by Mid-Atlantic Anglo-American and that this is now the de-facto universal language of modern technology. \linelabel{prodll77}This results in alienation at a local level and the loss of cultural identity, and it may\cbdelete{} restrict further evolutionary development instead of letting local entities show themselves appropriately through language. People in the dystopian technological era are compelled to use language to disclose things, but through the filter of the global technological system. \linelabel{prodll77a}

\linelabel{prodll80}\citeA{Winner1997} also maintains that technical innovations are no longer the neutral means to ends, but that they help to shape the ends of society itself. He contends that changes to the socio-political domain usually occur without public debate because technologies are not just aids to human activity, they manifest powerful forces that give meaning and direction to humanity, and so he demands to know: ``What kinds of personal practices, social relations, legal and political norms, and lasting institutions will emerge from this upheaval? More importantly, what kinds of practices, relations, rules, and institutions do we want to emerge in these settings?''~\citeyear{Winner1997}, while \citeA[p.~276]{Heidegger1981} insists that, ``technology is in its essence something which man cannot master by himself.'' \citeA[p.~202]{Zimmerman1990} would reply that, ``instead of mastering technology, technological humanity has developed remarkable disciplines designed to master humanity itself, so that individuals will be amenable to the demands of technological society.'' According to \citeA{Winner1986}, there are at least \cbstart{}five ways that\cbend{} technology might alter the socio-political terrain:
 \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item Technological advances in transportation and communications facilitate and encourage centralised control in virtually all institutions. 
\item The `economies of scale' associated with new techniques call for gigantic social structures \cbstart{}that\cbend{} were unheard of in previous centuries. 
\item The rational arrangement of technological systems produces its own forms of hierarchical authority independent of the political realm. 
\item Centralised, hierarchical technological systems tend to crowd out other types of human activity, for example agribusiness that displaces family farming. 
\item \label{num:winner}Large socio-technological organisations exercise undue influence on the very political structures designed to `control' those organisations. 
\end{inparaenum}\linelabel{prodll80a}

\citeA{Tannenbaum1952} and \citeA{Heidegger1981} agree that innovations have been depicted as labour saving, giving the consumer more time for leisure. This contention is brought into question if one asks: What happens with the extra time? \linelabel{prodll90}\cbdelete{}Time made available for leisure is consumed by the need to make more money to pay for more labour saving devices. It does appear that technology, rather than reducing the amount of work that has to be done, seems to be increasing it. Instead of there being fewer jobs, the number of occupations is increasing and people are performing tasks and incorporating technologies into Work that had not been thought of even a few years ago. In the meantime, some skilled occupations spawned by former technological developments no longer exist, an example being the printing industry's typographer is now extinct in \NZ{} and has been redefined as a Graphic Pre-press Trades Worker~\cite{Census2006}. The role has changed to meet the requirements of new technologies: workers have had to either retrain to stay in employment or find other occupations. There has been a massive growth in the leisure and entertainment industry during the previous and current centuries and it shows no sign of slowing, it looks as though the expansion will grow as fast as ever, if not faster. \linelabel{prodll90a}

\linelabel{prodll94}There is\cbdelete{} inevitability in the dystopian view that the human must change fundamentally to meet the juggernaut of technological development despite that \citeA{Dewey1938} said change occurs only at the cultural or societal level. What is the nature of change that needs to be made and in what form, should it take? The technological system creates the new dystopian technological human by making changes to the way it thinks, acts, and responds.\linelabel{prodll94a} What \citeA{Junger2007} recognises as the `worker' is defined by those perceptual patterns or shapes which possess the qualities of `worker' but that, as a whole, cannot be described merely as a sum of its parts. It is from the degree of influence of the printing and stamping received by the 'worker,' \Junger{} claims, that when one talks about Gestalt one is indeed referring to the highest meaningful reality and that the `worker' makes its appearance through symbols, representations or impressions. In the same way that the `Gestalt of the worker' embodies the totality that a `worker' may be, it may be said too that in the technological era, all are expressions of the `worker-soldier.'

\Junger{} was influenced strongly by his wartime experiences \cite<for example,>{Junger2003} with the result that he concluded that the best way for humanity to cope with the onslaught of modern technology was to embrace it wholeheartedly~\cite{Zimmerman1990}. From a utopian perspective, the overman \cite{Nietzsche1987} becomes the cybernetic future that retains elements of rational humanity without the irrational and emotional factors that have brought about the nihilism of the West. It was warfare that ``furthered the planetary technological \emph{Gestalt} by hastening the industrialisation process in which workers in factories and soldiers on the field became virtually indistinguishable. Soldiers consumed what the workers produced''~\cite[p.~51]{Zimmerman1990}. The result is a dystopian world, \cbdelete{}the relationship between producers and consumers of a perpetual war economy that elevates social and economic progress globally. 

\citeA{Zimmerman1990} refers to Heidegger's vision of the pre-technological era, a period when humanity still saw itself as part of nature and not as its master, and people were required to adapt themselves to a pre-existing natural order. A time recognisable to the ancient Greeks, in which there was a natural order to things and nature provided all that was good. \citeA{Dewey1939} tells us, for example, that Greek science operated with objects in the sense of stars, rocks, trees, the weather and other observable phenomena; but with the advent of experimentation, \linelabel{prodll98}those objects became data, which meant that they were freed up from the knowledge that had accreted to the objects, so they became subject to further interpretation. They became subjects that could be thought about rather than objects to be observed. Objects are in this sense, completed finalities, they are finished and are therefore available for definition, classification, logical arrangement, inclusion in syllogisms, whereas treating these same things as data suggests that they have become evidential, indicative, signifying, as clues pointing to some conclusion that is not yet reached. \cbstart{}Therefore,\cbend{} as data, they are mediated toward a means, rather than as an end in themselves. The shift in understanding is vitally important because it moves knowing from a revelatory or aesthetic enjoinment of the properties of nature as the result of divine art to one of knowing as a means of control. \linelabel{prodll98a}

\linelabel{prodll102}Control became secularised, moreover it was freed from the monastic tradition when science and religion were torn from each other,\footnote{Religion tended to be focussed on historical values and viewed objects as already finished, complete. Importantly, the attitude that objects are complete also suggests that they are beyond the control of the person. By extension, conduct, if viewed objectively, can therefore be seen as a means of exercising control, or as a fixed role that has been handed down from the divine.} so that the material of nature provided the means by which change could be effected.\linelabel{prodll102a} As \citeauthor{Dewey1939} says, ``when one change is given, and we know with measured accuracy its connection with another change, we have the potential means of producing or averting that other event\ldots{} The attitude of control looks to the future, to production''~\citeyear[p.~98]{Dewey1939}. \linelabel{prodll102b}Now, when nature proves unsatisfactory for human purposes, it is reframed so that it at least gives the appearance of correctness, even though it results in entities being represented in ways that are for them, obscene. Reframing becomes necessary to align naturally occurring entities with the human created conception of economic exigency.\linelabel{prodll102c}

\section{Dystopia and \IS} \label{sec:production:dystopiaIS}
\vspace{-0.5em}
Early approaches to the design of computerised systems in business involved the replication of processes that already existed~\cite<for example, >{GaneSarson1979}. The Transaction Processing System (\textsc{tps}) and its derivative information systems are now ubiquitous in the enterprise, having established a tight technological web that links all enterprises. The movement of the technological system is as a juggernaut that has been built around the exigency and expediency of pragmatic business mores. \citeA{Checkland1997} provides the example of those systems designed for the accounting focussed business environments that are designed with transaction control and processing in mind which reflects, the company's business processes. The Accounting Information System (\textsc{ais}) is clearly definable by its sets of processes and flows of data. It has become a model for predictability and its form is observable in information systems of various kinds. From Heidegger, \cbstart{}the Will to Will of\cbend{} the technological system moves towards a manifestation in which the system strives for ever greater production for its own sake. \citeA{Zimmerman1990} takes the position that the technological human is lost in the workings of the technological system, so that they have become irrational and must keep trying to improve what they have built  but the ``usual `means-end' interpretation of instruments\dots makes no sense when applied to the technological era: humanity has become the `means' for an end that lies beyond human control or ken''~\citeyear[p.~201]{Zimmerman1990}. \linelabel{prodll106}In the Will of the technological system, the human participant finds its place increasingly marked by the requirement to come to terms with the juggernaut. The human participant, the technological human, must incorporate technological developments into its personal and Work life so that the person can better express the Will of the juggernaut. \linelabel{prodll106a}

\citeA{Tannenbaum1952} tells how the separation between the life and work of the individual in society was in part caused by the industrialisation of society. \citeA{Masaryk1971} says that this process of separation was accompanied by the creation of the Work ethic, which is that Work is seen as something essentially good and of benefit to society. \linelabel{prodll108}Socially and culturally, there became a distinction between what you were paid to do when earning a money wage, and living a decent and moral life outside that with family and friends. This has created in society a polarised existence where a person's value is placed on their paid occupation and those who are not wage earners are seen as something lesser, as cop-outs from legitimate aims and aspirations. Whether this has changed the nature of the human, as \citeA{Dewey1938} said, there may be some doubt. \linelabel{prodll108a}

\linelabel{prodll110}\cbstart{}The human in its most basic form is social.\footnote{Refer to \S\ref{sec:intro.human} on page \pageref{sec:intro.human}.} Regardless of whether looks at humanity\cbend{} through the lens of tribalism or the simplified modern nuclear context, humans crave the intimacy of contact with each other. This means that communication for the human is fundamental for it to maintain and build its relationships with other humans. The advent of the cellular telephone has changed the way that people engage in communication, although it has not fundamentally changed the human need for contact. Instead, it offers greater access and opportunity for the fundamental urge to connect and communicate. \cbstart{}Before\cbend{} the widespread acceptance of the use of cellular technology, it was accepted and normal, that one might spend hours or days out of communication from their peers, family, friends, and colleagues. The social fabric of society was as much filled with the pauses in communication as it was with the interactions. When two people who had not seen each other for a period met, they would typically exchange greetings and a complex series of interactions would ensue, often in tandem. They would:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item Re-establish their social framework, such as the social placing or level, relationships, interconnections with others in the same social network.
\item Reconnect at an emotional level with where they were in their last encounter: \cbdelete{}if their previous encounter had been awkward or tense, then that would be the emotional state that predominates from the beginning of this encounter.
\item Update each other on what had occurred since their previous encounter, based on those points of commonality that exist between them.
\item Relate goals and aspirations, especially those that have been progressed. While doing these, they would
\item compare what they have seen or learned in the intervening period.
\end{inparaenum}

The introduction of the cell phone into the life of the technological human has had the effect that periods of non-communication have become interstitial. The expectation is that the technological human should be in constant contact: a curious reversal of the position taken by both \citeauthor{Tannenbaum1952} and \citeauthor{Masaryk1971}. In this instance, the cell phone has become a unifying technological artefact progressing the Will to Will of the technological system, and that draws the Work life and home life of the technological human together. It closes the gaps between communications instantiations, provides the immediacy of contact, but at the same time it merges burdens from the paid occupation of the individual with their other lives. It brings the pressures of belonging to polarise social orders into the same space and this creates friction and tension. The Will of the juggernaut is a constant reminder to act for the sake of its Will. 

\linelabel{prodll122}The technological human is subservient to the technological system and what is seen in the case of the person is reflected in the millions who are also tied in to it.  The cell phone is no longer just a means of communication; it is now a means to produce. The cell phone has moved from a communications device to a platform that permits the ongoing of Work even after the end of the working day. The mobile platform allows the technological human to conduct their work regardless of location, and facilitates the speeding up of certain kinds of transaction that might otherwise have required them to travel to a point where they could gain access to the information systems that either provided detail or where they could update or add new information.\linelabel{prodll121}

\linelabel{prodll125}It seems inevitable, in the dystopian view that the technological human must change fundamentally to accommodate the demands of the juggernaut. \cbstart{}Change occurs at the level of tradition or culture (the efforts of conservatism notwithstanding). What is the extent of change?\cbend{}\linelabel{prodll125a} \citeA{Dewey1938} says that human nature is essentially plastic and to change the nature of the person requires education, while there are certain properties of human nature that appear constant. He cites the example of the constant state of war and that the human is combative with an instinctual need to wage war. The human displays pugnacity, fear, pity, and sympathy, the human responds to stimuli through its instincts and war, he says, is merely the channel through which those responses are expressed. Just as the theatre of war may close and reopen elsewhere, those factors are to be found in cultural institutions or artefacts, whether one looks at family, religion, legal systems, or government, and they are all subject to change. The requirements to eat, sleep, reproduce, and so on are fundamental to the design of the organic species, but in themselves, these are properties of the person. \linelabel{prodll125b}\cbdelete{}Without them, the person does not exist. Through accommodations to the Will of the technological system, the technological human has learned to survive in the industrial landscape. The technological human has shed values and moral codes in favour of securing a money wage and has created for itself a technological society \cbstart{}that\cbend{} is predicated on the manufacture of industrial goods rather than social goods. The technological human is a cultural artefact, a by-product of technological society, and together they have produced the juggernaut. Thus, the Will to Will of the juggernaut effects change on the technological human.\linelabel{prodll125c}

\linelabel{prodll127}The separation between the human and nature, and its own nature to some extent has occurred as it has become subservient to the juggernaut. Nature often sets up inconvenient impediments to the progression of the juggernaut of the technological system and so nature is reframed. By reframing, technological change at least gives the appearance of correctness even though it results in entities being represented in unexpected ways. Most are familiar with the image of the call centre, occupied by rows of cubicled workers producing words like battery chickens producing eggs, performing virtually mindless acts from scripts that are provided for them on their computer screens. One may have seen the video clip of the worker who explodes into a rage and proceeds to kick their computer along the passageway while their co-workers look on in shock. The image is parodied and exampled throughout both fiction and non-fiction. Reframing becomes necessary to align naturally occurring entities with the human created conception of the economic model. The call-centre is the epitome of order and control, where processes are provided to deliver appropriate responses for any likely stimulus. The worker exists as part of the chain of events through which the caller is channelled with their enquiry or complaint, and there is no scope for variation unless the call is escalated to a point where some autonomy is allowed. Is this a natural state for the human? \Junger{} said that peace \cbstart{}could\cbend{} only be found when you release self-control and give it over to the machine. The \cbdelete{}rational existence that permits only specific responses runs counter to the apparent state of chaos that defines the mind-states of most people. Depression and frustration are by-products of the relinquishing of the supremacy of the self and giving it over to the machine. Suppression and depression are the lot of the technological human who is lost in the dystopian system of productionist metaphysics.\linelabel{prodll127a}

\section{Productionist metaphysics and Web 2.0} \label{sec:production:web2.0}
\vspace{0.5em}
\linelabel{prodll132}Escape from dystopian productionist metaphysics lies in one's capacity to belong through  attachment to one's own beingness. To belong to a social and cultural formation, future or past, or that part of the system that offers the most pleasure or the least pain. Accepting that for the modern human, its destiny is as much tied to that of the system as it is to its own.\linelabel{prodll132a} \citeA{Tannenbaum1952} refers to the pre-industrial period when a community was defined by the interconnectedness of its parts \cbstart{}through\cbend{} social frameworks \cbdelete{}or \cbstart{}environmental\cbend{} dependence. \cbdelete{}\cbstart{}There existed\cbend{} complimentary development of skills so that in the community, there were always those who could ensure that at least the essential functions of society were kept in order. Social mores \cbstart{}based on\cbend{}\cbdelete{} traditions, values, a shared history and\cbdelete{} a spiritual link that tied the community together, \cbstart{}kept aberrant behaviour in check.\cbend{}\cbdelete{} \linelabel{prodll132b}In the process of industrialisation and the movement toward the urban environment, humanity lost these anchors and workers from the country became fodder for the formation of the juggernaut. Their future became inextricably tied to the fate of the industrial complex, and all knowledge of their previous history was lost in but a few generations.\linelabel{prodll132c}

\linelabel{prodll137}Is there an escape from the juggernaut or should the person \cbstart{}retake control of their Will?\cbend{} Perhaps escape requires a reversal of the process of which the technological human is the result, such as those who opt out of society and reject the apparent purposeless of productionism. In the extreme are Marxists who advocate the destruction of urban social structures and a return to the rural existence of peasant life, such as the case of the Khmer Rouge in 1970s Cambodia. For most, the possibility of becoming Luddites and rejecting technology is entirely alien and consideration of an alternative must be given: the technological human must take back control of its destiny and regain attributes lost in its technological transition.

The development of Web 2.0 technologies has seen a move away from dystopian productionist metaphysics by bringing into the design process, human factors of participation, development through the open source community, distribution through syndication, and allowance of change and variation through the concept of the perpetual beta \cite{Sutter2009}. These factors redefine Work from being solely a means of production, to include social aspects that take into account the natural propensity for the technological human to network, and accumulate links in order to build value. Thus, Work is separated from the means of producing through the application of specific tools.\linelabel{prodll139} \citeA{Zimmerman1990} refers to the manner in which tools that \cbstart{}function as designed,\cbend{} effectively disappear from the worker's consciousness and only become visible when  ``they are \emph{missing}, when they \emph{don't work}, or when they \emph{get in the way}''~\citeyear[p.~139]{Zimmerman1990}. \linelabel{prodll140}\cbstart{}However,\cbend{} Web 2.0 itself has become a phenomenon, \cbstart{}the technology has begun to lead organisational changes.\cbend{}\linelabel{prodll140a}

\newpage{}\linelabel{prodll142}Through the lens of productionist metaphysics is seen the distinction between `production' and `making' in the Greek sense, and `production processes' in the technological age, where the industrialisation of the West has brought about the formation of the juggernaut that produced a technological society and human. As \cbdelete{}discussed, the technological human faces a \cbstart{}purposeless existence,\cbend{} and in response to that realisation, technological humanity attempts to rationalise its world. The technological human's attempts at rationalisation have their appearance \cbdelete{}through defining \cbstart{}every other thing\cbend{} a purpose or its use as an instrument, and Web 2.0 is one such attempt at rationalisation.\linelabel{prodll142a} In this case, Web 2.0 is a set of tools, each of which that are not in themselves new or innovative. To redefine those features under the banner of Web 2.0, \citeA{Oreilly2005} mentions the place \cbdelete{}held by data, that the architecture encourages participation amongst users, so that the collaborative nature of the open source community can be leveraged to generate applications. Readers can participate by linking to content updates and continuing the sociotechnical trend, and the acceptance that application development is both never ending and is led by the users and readers of content. These features produce for \citeauthor{Oreilly2005} the concept of `Web 2.0 as a platform.' Whereas the Internet had been perceived as a means of distribution of content, now it is a major component of the technological age. 

\linelabel{prodll145}While for technological humanity, there is a sense of completeness and security in knowing that all exists because it is meant to be, this sense masks purposelessness. Technological humanity's self-realisation, that it has lost its human purpose, creates the conditions for the rationalisation of the productionist world it finds itself in. If technological humanity's destiny is tied to that of the technological system, and if the system fails, so too does the technological human and the worlds it has built. Therefore, the technological human is tasked with maintaining the system to protect \cbdelete{}the system, itself, and its worlds. The purposes of industrial manufacturing from its early days, for example, that employment in manufacturing would keep the idle employed, keep the poor warm, and ``fill the mouths of the hungry''~\cite[p.~259]{Niles1823} is lost now. It is but the Will to Will that keeps the juggernaut rolling and here lies the means by which purpose for the human may be regained. If all that the technological system demands is to produce in order to produce, then the directive may be redirected to fit any purpose the technological human desires. Web 2.0 is a technological artefact\label{text:production:artefact} that as a collaborative environment, \cbstart{}it exists as a set of tools that can be applied to any task with a purpose. This point supported by \citeA{Oreilly2005}\cbend{} who says that the platform concept of Web 2.0 serves various groups in differing ways, from it as a platform for business, to a communications channel for marketing, to providing infrastructure for new media distribution for journalism and entertainment, and as a platform for software development for developers.\linelabel{prodll145a}

The features found in many Web 2.0 applications that \citeA{KimYuePerkinsHallGates2009} refer to can be used to bend the purposes of the technological system in productionist metaphysics. \linelabel{prodll148}First,\cbdelete{} Web 2.0 relies on the willing participation and collaboration of contributors to both its development and use. As more Web 2.0 applications such as social networking sites, syndication of news feeds, creation and maintenance of blogs, and sharing of media files like photographs and video are created, then, the more Web 2.0 is able to remediate the social functions that \citeA{Tannenbaum1952} said had been eliminated from society. The wiki provides an example of both participation and collaboration for contributors to work together with a common goal or aim in mind, but \cbstart{}the form is\cbend{} not determined by the system. Therefore, the purpose of the wiki is not defined by the technology but by those who use it.\linelabel{prodll148a}

\linelabel{prodll152}\citeA{Dennison2007} makes reference to a fear that the introduction of Web 2.0 tools into the enterprise will result in some kind of corporate meltdown and that its secrets will be held manifest. However \citeA{MajchrzakCherbakovIves2009} illustrate that the reverse is true, that the person will use technology in a responsible and knowledgeable fashion. Such examples as \citeA{MajchrzakCherbakovIves2009} and \citeA{Dennison2007} provide support for the premise \citeA{Tannenbaum1952} made, that the workers who found themselves displaced in a foreign industrialised urban environment set about rebuilding some of the social fabric they had lost. The rebuilding of social networks and the re-establishment of moral and ethical boundaries represent the part \cbstart{}that \citeA{Dewey1938} refers to: the human form that is natural and slow to change.\cbend{}\linelabel{prodll152a} In \citeA{Dennison2007}, \cbstart{}BT workers,\cbend{} rather than acting maliciously or irresponsibly against their employer, acted in a way that was positive and responsible and the system provided proved so popular that it quickly became overloaded. \linelabel{prodll152b}Their Work, in association with their desire to be morally and socially good, enabled the workers in BT to construct a purposeful social network that was beneficial to both themselves and the enterprise. The social networks they built take the concepts of participation and collaboration further in order to fulfil social and cultural norms. Social networks, say \citeA{KimYuePerkinsHallGates2009}, are built to facilitate the establishment and maintenance of social connection both in private, public, and Work oriented situations.\linelabel{prodll152c}

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:production:conclusion}
\nobreak
\linelabel{prodll157}The technological world, as an abstraction, exists within the minds of those who have established it. This is the form of the juggernaut, \cbstart{}which\cbend{} is not a physical manifestation of some technological horror but the sum of the collective Will of those who participate. For every person, the juggernaut takes on a different appearance and form that is composed of the instantiation of the component parts \cbstart{}with which they interact.\cbend{} As a whole, the technological world can barely be perceived by the technological human because for it, the system is too large and too complex to hold in its mind. Yet, \cbstart{}does this put off\cbend{} the human participant? It seems not, with increasingly larger numbers joining the throngs in the Web 2.0 space. \cbdelete{}Are their efforts to be involved a conscious and deliberate act to escape productionist metaphysical pressures? There still exists in the technological human attributes that denote its humanity as a moral and social animal and that it is those desires that continue to draw it back to its natural state~\cite{Masaryk1971}.\linelabel{prodll157a} \linelabel{prodll157b}Web 2.0 provides the means by which they can use the `system' to express those desires, whether consciously or otherwise. However, to escape productionist metaphysical constraints, the tools provided in the Web 2.0 space need to lower the barriers for the technological human to engage to the extent that any personal inertia that prevents engagement socially, is overcome. Web 2.0 applications ought to provide an interface through which the technological human can interact, share, and access Web content. Consistency is therefore vital to their success and so too are the languages that are used to develop them. \linelabel{prodll157c}\citeA{KimYuePerkinsHallGates2009} refer to this as the `rich user experience,' \cbdelete{}seen in the case at IBM where communities have sprung up inside the corporate structure of the enterprise. \linelabel{prodll157d}Consistency goes further, where a logically structured environment enables interoperability between communities and to be realised, requires that an abstracted version of reality must be created so that a generalisable schema can be created.\linelabel{prodll157e}

\linelabel{prodll161}The call for the technological human is for it to come to terms with the juggernaut. To challenge the juggernaut head-on will not produce anything but undesirable results since they are part of the same `system.'\linelabel{prodll161a} \linelabel{prodll161b}In coming to terms with \cbstart{}being, the technological human must take recourse into what is for it, the customary and traditional habits \cite{Dewey1938}. Dewey\cbend{} says it is ``hard to teach an old dog new tricks and it is harder yet to teach society to adopt customs which are contrary to those which have long prevailed''~\citeyear[p.~9]{Dewey1938}.\linelabel{prodll161c} He says there are few social changes that can be opposed \cbstart{}because\cbend{} they are contrary to human nature itself. \linelabel{prodll161d}The technological system is an expression of the natural human urge to make, produce, and therefore Work. The `system' has produced the phenomenon of Web 2.0 and so by proxy, Web 2.0 is no more than an expression of the human urge to make and produce.\linelabel{prodll161e} \citeA{Dennison2007} claims that much of what makes social media successful on the Internet, does not directly translate to the corporate environment. He mentions the concept of the `wisdom of crowds,' where `truth' can be exposed if there are enough people `producing' on one topic, but questions whether that would necessarily apply in the corporate context where the population is smaller. \linelabel{prodll161f}What \citeauthor{Dennison2007} seems to fail to appreciate with this question is that Web 2.0 expands the territorial boundaries that were limited by corporate designations. The abstract conception of the `company' is limited by the traditional organisational structure, where the gate-keepers of the enterprise need to learn that they can have faith in their workers to Work in the best interests of the organisation. \linelabel{prodll161g}

\linelabel{prodll167}Unless the enterprise learns by what is happening in the world, then the \cbstart{}effects of social re-engagement will overtake it. The enterprise adapts and learns to change its nature will survive; those that do not become dead-end in a game of technological evolutionary advantage.\cbend{} The gathering of momentum in the `system,' that has entwined the human into its purposes and engulfed it with its own Will, must do the same with the enterprise. The enterprise is a social artefact produced by human endeavour just as Web 2.0 is a technological artefact and together they are part of the destiny of the technological human. Efforts to resist the influence of the technological system are in vain and so \cbstart{}with\cbend{} the enterprise too, must come to terms with the juggernaut.\linelabel{prodll167a}

\linelabel{prodll169}The technological human that has come to terms with its place in the `system,' incorporates technological developments into all parts of it, and this is extrapolated to incorporate the rest of society. \cbstart{}In the merger of personal and Work life, the technological human has no more social, cultural, or traditional barriers to overcome.\cbend{} The cycle of separation that started with \citeA{Smith1937} is closed and the technological human, irrevocably changed from that `country innocent' that first washed up on the urban shore to earn a money wage. The technological human seeks return to the community-sense that was lost, but finds that sense in Work and through technology, in this instance Web 2.0. Just as productionist industry reframes nature to suit momentary purposes, so has the natural state of the human been reframed, to include Web 2.0 in the make-up and purposes of the technological human.\linelabel{prodll169a}

\newpage{}In chapter \ref{chap:democrat}, democratisation of Work is viewed in relation to the technological artefact, Web 2.0. \cbstart{}Work, that had previously been defined in the productionist context, is redefined under the lens of democracy.\cbend{} The democratisation of Work represents a shift in the asymmetric distribution of power in the enterprise, where the role of the technological human now has access to mechanisms and processes that allow greater participation in formative decision making. If the democratisation of Work is to be successful, then responsibility must be passed down through the enterprise, and the person or team given a high degree of autonomy. This gives rise to the conception that the person is less subservient to the technological system and adopts the status~of~`participant.'

\textls[-12]{The redefinition of Work provides the opportunity for Work and associated environments to be reframed, and that means the natural state of the human is\cbdelete{} reframed to include the technological human and the `participant' as the naturalised technological human.}
